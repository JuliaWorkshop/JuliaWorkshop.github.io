**Survival Analysis with Julia: A 12-Week Course**

**Course Description:**

This course provides an introduction to survival analysis, a statistical methodology crucial for analyzing time-to-event data. We will explore key concepts, models, and their implementation using the Julia programming language. 

**Course Objectives:**

* Understand fundamental concepts in survival analysis, including survival functions, hazard functions, and censoring.
* Learn to estimate and interpret survival probabilities using Kaplan-Meier curves.
* Master the use of the Cox proportional hazards model for analyzing the relationship between covariates and survival time.
* Explore advanced topics such as time-dependent covariates, competing risks, and frailty models.
* Gain proficiency in implementing survival analysis techniques using the Julia programming language and its relevant packages.

**Course Schedule:**

**Week 1: Introduction to Survival Analysis**
    * Definition and applications of survival analysis.
    * Types of time-to-event data: right-censored, left-censored, interval-censored.
    * Survival and hazard functions: definitions, interpretations, and relationships.
    * **Julia Packages:** `DataFrames`, `Plots` (for data manipulation and visualization)

**Week 2: Kaplan-Meier Estimator**
    * Estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method.
    * Plotting and interpreting Kaplan-Meier curves.
    * Log-rank test for comparing survival curves between groups.
    * **Julia Packages:** `Survival`, `Distributions` (for survival curve estimation and statistical tests)

**Week 3: Cox Proportional Hazards Model**
    * Introduction to the Cox proportional hazards model.
    * Model assumptions and diagnostics.
    * Fitting the Cox model in Julia using the `Survival` package.
    * Interpretation of model coefficients and hazard ratios.

**Week 4: Model Selection and Validation**
    * Variable selection methods in Cox regression (e.g., stepwise selection, LASSO).
    * Model validation techniques (e.g., cross-validation, bootstrap).
    * Assessing model fit and goodness-of-fit tests.
    * **Julia Packages:** `GLM`, `MLJ` (for model selection and evaluation)

**Week 5: Time-Dependent Covariates**
    * Definition and interpretation of time-dependent covariates.
    * Fitting Cox models with time-dependent covariates in Julia.
    * Applications of time-dependent covariates in real-world scenarios.

**Week 6: Competing Risks**
    * Introduction to competing risks analysis.
    * Estimation of cause-specific hazard functions.
    * Fine-Gray regression model for competing risks.
    * **Julia Packages:** `Survival` (for competing risks analysis)

**Week 7: Frailty Models**
    * Introduction to frailty models for handling unobserved heterogeneity.
    * Shared frailty models and random effects models.
    * Fitting frailty models in Julia.

**Week 8: Advanced Topics in Survival Analysis**
    * Recurrent event data analysis.
    * Multi-state models.
    * Bayesian methods for survival analysis.

**Week 9-12: Case Studies and Projects**
    * In-depth analysis of real-world survival data using Julia.
    * Student projects focusing on specific research questions or applications.
    * Presentation and discussion of student projects.

**Assessment:**

* Weekly assignments (problem sets, coding exercises)
* Midterm exam
* Final project and presentation

**Prerequisites:**

* Basic understanding of statistical concepts (e.g., probability distributions, hypothesis testing)
* Familiarity with the Julia programming language (basic data structures, functions, control flow)

**Software:**

* Julia programming language
* Julia packages: `Survival`, `DataFrames`, `Plots`, `Distributions`, `GLM`, `MLJ` (and others as needed)

### Jensen's Alpha 

Jensen's alpha is a performance measure used in finance to determine the excess return of a portfolio over its expected return, given its level of systematic risk. Essentially, it helps assess whether a portfolio manager has added value through their investment decisions.

The formula for Jensen's alpha is:

$$\alpha = R_i - \left(R_f + \beta_i \left(R_m - R_f\right)\right)$$

where:

- \(R_i\) = Actual return of the portfolio
- \(R_f\) = Risk-free rate
- \(\beta_i\) = Beta of the portfolio (a measure of its sensitivity to market movements)
- \(R_m\) = Return of the market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A positive Jensen's alpha indicates that the portfolio has outperformed its expected return, suggesting that the manager's decisions have added value. 

Conversely, a negative Jensen's alpha suggests underperformance. It's a useful tool for evaluating the performance of actively managed portfolios relative to their benchmarks.
1. **Install required packages:**
   You'll need the `DataFrames` and `Statistics` packages. You can install them using the following commands:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add("DataFrames")
   Pkg.add("Statistics")
   ```

2. **Load the packages:**
   ```julia
   using DataFrames
   using Statistics
   ```

3. **Define the necessary data:**
   You'll need the actual portfolio returns, risk-free rate, market returns, and the portfolio beta.
   ```julia
   actual_returns = [0.05, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.01]  # Example actual portfolio returns
   risk_free_rate = 0.01  # Example risk-free rate
   market_returns = [0.04, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.015]  # Example market returns
   beta = 1.2  # Example portfolio beta
   ```

4. **Calculate the average returns:**
   ```julia
   average_actual_return = mean(actual_returns)
   average_market_return = mean(market_returns)
   ```

5. **Calculate the expected return:**
   ```julia
   expected_return = risk_free_rate + beta * (average_market_return - risk_free_rate)
   ```

6. **Calculate Jensen's alpha:**
   ```julia
   jensens_alpha = average_actual_return - expected_return
   ```

7. **Print the result:**
   ```julia
   println("Jensen's Alpha: ", jensens_alpha)
   ```

Here's the complete code:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("DataFrames")
Pkg.add("Statistics")

using DataFrames
using Statistics

actual_returns = [0.05, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.01]  # Example actual portfolio returns
risk_free_rate = 0.01  # Example risk-free rate
market_returns = [0.04, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.015]  # Example market returns
beta = 1.2  # Example portfolio beta

average_actual_return = mean(actual_returns)
average_market_return = mean(market_returns)

expected_return = risk_free_rate + beta * (average_market_return - risk_free_rate)

jensens_alpha = average_actual_return - expected_return

println("Jensen's Alpha: ", jensens_alpha)
```

You can run this code in Julia to calculate Jensen's alpha for the given data. You can adjust the `actual_returns`, `risk_free_rate`, `market_returns`, and `beta` to match your specific scenario.

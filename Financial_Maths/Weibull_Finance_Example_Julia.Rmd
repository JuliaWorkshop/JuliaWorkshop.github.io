**Weibull Distribution: A Worked Example for Finance Students**

The Weibull distribution is a versatile probability distribution that can be applied to various fields, including finance. It's particularly useful for modeling the time until a specific event occurs, such as default or bankruptcy. 

**Understanding the Weibull Distribution**

The Weibull distribution is characterized by two parameters:

* **Shape parameter (k):** Determines the shape of the distribution.
    * k < 1: Decreasing failure rate
    * k = 1: Constant failure rate (exponential distribution)
    * k > 1: Increasing failure rate
* **Scale parameter (λ):** Influences the scale of the distribution.

**Probability Density Function (PDF):**
```
f(x; k, λ) = (k/λ) * (x/λ)^(k-1) * exp(-(x/λ)^k)
```

**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
```
F(x; k, λ) = 1 - exp(-(x/λ)^k)
```

**Worked Example: Modeling Default Time**

Suppose we want to model the time until a company defaults. We have historical data on default times for similar companies and estimate the shape parameter (k) to be 2 and the scale parameter (λ) to be 5 years.

**1. Probability of Default Within 3 Years:**

To calculate the probability that a company defaults within 3 years, we use the CDF:

```
P(X ≤ 3) = F(3; 2, 5) = 1 - exp(-(3/5)^2) ≈ 0.3012
```
So, there's a 30.12% chance the company will default within 3 years.

**2. Expected Default Time:**

The expected value (mean) of a Weibull distribution with parameters k and λ is:

```
E[X] = λ * Γ(1 + 1/k)
```

where Γ is the gamma function. 

Using a calculator or statistical software, we find:

```
E[X] = 5 * Γ(1 + 1/2) ≈ 3.5355 years
```

Therefore, the expected default time for a company is approximately 3.54 years.

**3. Median Default Time:**

The median default time is the time at which 50% of the companies have defaulted. We can find it by setting the CDF equal to 0.5:

```
0.5 = 1 - exp(-(x/5)^2)
```

Solving for x, we get:

```
x ≈ 3.364 years
```

So, half of the companies are expected to default within 3.36 years.

**Applications in Finance**

* **Credit Risk Modeling:** Assessing the probability of default for loans and bonds.
* **Operational Risk:** Modeling the time until a specific operational event, like a system failure.
* **Insurance:** Analyzing the time until a claim is filed.
* **Portfolio Management:** Incorporating default probabilities into investment decisions.

By understanding and applying the Weibull distribution, finance professionals can make more informed decisions and manage risk effectively.

```julia
using Distributions, SpecialFunctions

# Parameters
k = 2.0  # Shape parameter
λ = 5.0  # Scale parameter

# 1. Probability of Default Within 3 Years
probability_default_3 = cdf(Weibull(k, λ), 3)
println("Probability of default within 3 years: ", probability_default_3)

# 2. Expected Default Time
expected_default_time = λ * gamma(1 + 1/k)
println("Expected default time: ", expected_default_time)

# 3. Median Default Time
# We need to solve for x in the equation: 0.5 = 1 - exp(-(x/λ)^k)
# Rearranging, we get: (x/λ)^k = -log(0.5)  => x = λ * (-log(0.5))^(1/k)
median_default_time = λ * (-log(0.5))^(1/k)
println("Median default time: ", median_default_time)


# --- Example using the Distributions package more directly ---
# Create a Weibull distribution object
weibull_dist = Weibull(k, λ)

# 1. Probability of Default Within 3 Years (using Distributions package)
probability_default_3_dist = cdf(weibull_dist, 3)
println("Probability of default within 3 years (Distributions): ", probability_default_3_dist)

# 2. Expected Default Time (using Distributions package)
expected_default_time_dist = mean(weibull_dist) # Or using the formula as above.
println("Expected default time (Distributions): ", expected_default_time_dist)

# 3. Median Default Time (using Distributions package)
median_default_time_dist = quantile(weibull_dist, 0.5)
println("Median default time (Distributions): ", median_default_time_dist)


# --- Demonstrating the shape parameter's effect ---
# Example with k < 1 (decreasing failure rate)
weibull_dist_k_less_than_1 = Weibull(0.5, λ)
println("\nExample with k < 1 (decreasing failure rate):")
println("Expected default time: ", mean(weibull_dist_k_less_than_1))

# Example with k = 1 (constant failure rate - Exponential)
weibull_dist_k_equals_1 = Weibull(1.0, λ) # Equivalent to Exponential(λ)
println("\nExample with k = 1 (constant failure rate - Exponential):")
println("Expected default time: ", mean(weibull_dist_k_equals_1))

# Example with k > 1 (increasing failure rate) - Our original case
println("\nExample with k > 1 (increasing failure rate):")
println("Expected default time: ", mean(weibull_dist)) # Our original distribution


# --- Plotting the PDF and CDF (for visualization) ---
using Plots
x_values = range(0, 20, length=100)  # Values for plotting
plot(x_values, pdf.(weibull_dist, x_values), label="PDF", xlabel="Time (Years)", ylabel="Probability Density")
plot!(x_values, cdf.(weibull_dist, x_values), label="CDF")
savefig("weibull_plot.png") # Saves the plot to a file. You can also use display() to show it.

```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1.  **`Distributions` Package:**  We use the `Distributions` package, which is the standard way to work with probability distributions in Julia.  This provides functions like `cdf`, `mean`, and `quantile` directly for the Weibull distribution.  It's much cleaner and more efficient than manually implementing the formulas.

2.  **`SpecialFunctions` Package:** The `SpecialFunctions` package is used for the Gamma function (`gamma()`), which is required for the analytical calculation of the mean.

3.  **Clearer Variable Names:**  More descriptive variable names (e.g., `probability_default_3` instead of just `p`) improve readability.

4.  **Direct Calculation of Median:** The median calculation is now done more directly using the formula derived from the CDF. It's also now calculated using the `quantile` function from the `Distributions` package.

5.  **Demonstration of Shape Parameter's Effect:** The code now includes examples showing how the shape parameter (`k`) affects the expected default time.  This is crucial for understanding the Weibull distribution.

6.  **Plotting:** The code now uses the `Plots` package to visualize the PDF and CDF. This is extremely helpful for understanding the distribution's behavior.  Remember to install the `Plots` package if you haven't already: `] add Plots` in the Julia REPL.

7.  **Comments and Explanations:**  Added more comments to explain each part of the code, making it easier to follow.

8.  **`using` statements:** Explicitly `using` the necessary packages makes the code more robust.

**How to Run:**

1.  **Install Julia:** If you don't have Julia installed, download it from [https://julialang.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://julialang.org/).
2.  **Install Packages:** Open the Julia REPL (command-line interface) and type the following, pressing Enter after each line:
    ```julia
    ] add Distributions
    ] add SpecialFunctions
    ] add Plots
    ```
3.  **Save the Code:** Save the Julia code above as a `.jl` file (e.g., `weibull_example.jl`).
4.  **Run from the REPL:** In the Julia REPL, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run it:
    ```julia
    include("weibull_example.jl")
    ```

The output will be printed to the console, and the plot will be saved as `weibull_plot.png` in the same directory.

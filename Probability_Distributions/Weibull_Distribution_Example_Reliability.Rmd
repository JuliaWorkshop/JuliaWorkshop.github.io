### Reliability - Worked Example

<h3>Reliability - Worked Example</h3>
Let's create a worked example on how the Weibull distribution can be applied to reliability analysis using Julia. We'll walk through the process of fitting a Weibull distribution to a dataset representing the failure times of components, and then we'll use this distribution to calculate reliability metrics such as the probability of failure within a certain time period and the mean time to failure.

#### Step-by-Step Example

**1. Generating Synthetic Failure Data**

First, let's generate synthetic data representing the failure times of 100 components. We'll use a Weibull distribution with shape parameter \( \alpha = 1.5 \) and scale parameter \( \beta = 5000 \).

```julia
using Random
using Distributions
using Plots

# Set seed for reproducibility
Random.seed!(42)

# Generating synthetic failure times
shape_param = 1.5
scale_param = 5000
failure_times = rand(Weibull(shape_param, scale_param), 100)
println(first(failure_times, 6))
```

**2. Fitting a Weibull Distribution to the Data**

Next, we will fit a Weibull distribution to the generated data using the `fit` function from the `Distributions` package.

```julia
# Fitting a Weibull distribution to the failure data
weibull_fit = fit(Weibull, failure_times)
println(weibull_fit)
```

**3. Calculating Reliability Metrics**

Now that we have a fitted Weibull distribution, let's calculate some reliability metrics.

**a. Probability of Failure Within a Certain Time Period**

We can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to calculate the probability of failure within a certain time period. For example, let's calculate the probability of failure within 4000 hours.

```julia
time_period = 4000
prob_failure = cdf(weibull_fit, time_period)
println("Probability of failure within $time_period hours: $prob_failure")
```

**b. Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)**

The mean time to failure (MTTF) is the expected value of the failure time for the Weibull distribution. It can be calculated using the `mean` function.

```julia
mttf = mean(weibull_fit)
println("Mean Time to Failure (MTTF): $mttf hours")
```

**4. Plotting the Reliability Function**

The reliability function, which is the complement of the CDF, gives the probability of survival beyond a certain time period. Let's plot the reliability function.

```julia
# Calculating reliability function values
reliability = 1 .- cdf.(weibull_fit, x)
plot(x, reliability, label="Reliability", title="Weibull Reliability Function", ylabel="Reliability", xlabel="Time (hours)")
```

### Summary
- We generated synthetic failure data from a Weibull distribution.
- Fitted a Weibull distribution to the data.
- Calculated key reliability metrics such as the probability of failure within a certain time period and the mean time to failure (MTTF).
- Plotted the reliability function.

This example demonstrates how the Weibull distribution can be effectively used in reliability analysis to predict the failure behavior of components.

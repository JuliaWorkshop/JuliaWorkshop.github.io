### The Log-Normal Distribution

<h3>Working with the Log-Normal Distribution in Julia</h3>

This tutorial will guide you through using the Log-Normal distribution in Julia with the `Distributions.jl` package.  The Log-Normal distribution is useful for modeling data that is positive and skewed, often encountered in fields like finance, economics, and environmental science.

**1. Setting up:**

First, make sure you have Julia installed. Then, open the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and install the `Distributions` package if you haven't already:

```julia
] add Distributions
```

After installation, load the package:

```julia
using Distributions
```

**2. Creating a Log-Normal distribution:**

The Log-Normal distribution is parameterized by two values:

* `μ` (mu): The mean of the *underlying* normal distribution.
* `σ` (sigma): The standard deviation of the *underlying* normal distribution.

*Important Note:*  `mu` and `sigma` are *not* the mean and standard deviation of the log-normal distribution itself.  They are the parameters of the normal distribution you'd get if you took the logarithm of your log-normally distributed data.

Here's how to create a Log-Normal distribution with `μ = 0` and `σ = 1`:

```julia
d = LogNormal(0, 1)
```

You can create a distribution with different parameters:

```julia
d2 = LogNormal(2, 0.5)  # μ = 2, σ = 0.5
```

**3. Basic Operations:**

* **Generating random samples:**

```julia
rand(d, 10) # Generates 10 random numbers from the distribution 'd'
```

* **Probability Density Function (PDF):**  The PDF gives the probability density at a given value.

```julia
pdf(d, 1.0) # Probability density at x = 1.0
```

* **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** The CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a given value.

```julia
cdf(d, 1.0) # Probability that x <= 1.0
```

* **Quantile Function (Inverse CDF):** The quantile function finds the value below which a given proportion of the data falls.

```julia
quantile(d, 0.95) # Value below which 95% of the data falls
```

* **Mean and Standard Deviation:** Remember these are *not* the `mu` and `sigma` you used to create the distribution.

```julia
mean(d)
std(d)
```

* **Variance:**

```julia
var(d)
```

**4. Fitting a Log-Normal distribution to data:**

Let's say you have some data that you suspect follows a Log-Normal distribution. You can fit the distribution to the data using the `fit_mle` function (Maximum Likelihood Estimation):

```julia
data = rand(LogNormal(1, 0.5), 1000) # Generate some sample data
d_fit = fit_mle(LogNormal, data) # Fit the distribution

println(d_fit) # Print the fitted distribution parameters
```

**5. Working with Logarithms:**

The key to the Log-Normal distribution is its relationship to the Normal distribution. If `X` is log-normally distributed, then `log(X)` is normally distributed.  This can be very useful:

```julia
x = rand(d)  # A random value from the LogNormal distribution
y = log(x)   # The logarithm of x; y will be normally distributed

# You can check this:
typeof(y) # Float64

# If you know the parameters of the underlying normal distribution, you can
# calculate the mean and variance of the log-normal distribution:
mu = 0
sigma = 1
lognormal_mean = exp(mu + sigma^2/2)
lognormal_variance = (exp(sigma^2) - 1) * exp(2*mu + sigma^2)
println("Theoretical lognormal mean: ", lognormal_mean)
println("Theoretical lognormal variance: ", lognormal_variance)
```

**Example: Visualizing the distribution:**

```julia
using Plots
x_values = range(0.01, 10, length=100) # Values for plotting
plot(x_values, pdf.(d, x_values), label="PDF", xlabel="x", ylabel="f(x)")
plot!(x_values, cdf.(d, x_values), label="CDF")
```

This will create a plot of the PDF and CDF of the Log-Normal distribution.  Remember to install Plots.jl if you haven't already: `] add Plots`

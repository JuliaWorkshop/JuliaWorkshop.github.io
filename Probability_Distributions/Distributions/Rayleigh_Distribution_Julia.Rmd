### The Rayleigh distribution 

<h3>The Rayleigh distribution </h3>
The Rayleigh distribution with a Julia implementation.

**Description of the Rayleigh Distribution**

The Rayleigh distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes the magnitude of a vector whose components are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) standard normal random variables (zero mean and unit variance).  In simpler terms, it often arises when you're dealing with the *magnitude* of a random variable that can vary in two perpendicular directions (like the wind speed in the x and y directions).  It's characterized by a single parameter, σ (sigma), which is a scale parameter related to the root mean square of the underlying normal variables.

* **Probability Density Function (PDF):**
   ```
   f(x; σ) = (x/σ^2) * exp(-x^2 / (2σ^2))  for x ≥ 0
   ```
   and f(x; σ) = 0 otherwise.

* **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
   ```
   F(x; σ) = 1 - exp(-x^2 / (2σ^2))  for x ≥ 0
   ```
   and F(x; σ) = 0 otherwise.

* **Key Properties:**
    * **Mean:** σ * sqrt(π/2)
    * **Variance:** (4 - π)/2 * σ^2
    * **Mode:** σ
    * **Median:** σ * sqrt(ln(4))

**Julia Implementation**

```julia
using Distributions
using Plots

# Define the scale parameter (sigma)
sigma = 2.0

# Create a Rayleigh distribution object
rayleigh_dist = Rayleigh(sigma)

# Generate some random samples
num_samples = 1000
samples = rand(rayleigh_dist, num_samples)

# Calculate the PDF at specific points
x_values = range(0, 3*sigma, length=200)  # Range for plotting
pdf_values = pdf.(rayleigh_dist, x_values)

# Calculate the CDF at specific points
cdf_values = cdf.(rayleigh_dist, x_values)

# Plot the PDF and histogram
histogram(samples, bins=50, density=true, label="Histogram of Samples",
           xlabel="x", ylabel="Probability Density", title="Rayleigh Distribution (σ = $sigma)")
plot!(x_values, pdf_values, label="PDF", linewidth=2, color=:red)

# Plot the CDF
plot(x_values, cdf_values, label="CDF", linewidth=2, color=:blue,
     xlabel="x", ylabel="Cumulative Probability", title="Rayleigh CDF (σ = $sigma)")


# Calculate and print some statistics
println("Mean: ", mean(rayleigh_dist))
println("Variance: ", var(rayleigh_dist))
println("Mode: ", mode(rayleigh_dist))
println("Median: ", median(rayleigh_dist))

# Display both plots
display(plot!(x_values, pdf_values, label="PDF", linewidth=2, color=:red))
display(plot(x_values, cdf_values, label="CDF", linewidth=2, color=:blue))


```

**Explanation of the Julia Code:**

1. **`using Distributions`:** Imports the `Distributions` package, which provides tools for working with probability distributions.
2. **`using Plots`:** Imports the `Plots` package for creating visualizations.
3. **`sigma = 2.0`:** Sets the scale parameter σ.
4. **`rayleigh_dist = Rayleigh(sigma)`:** Creates a `Rayleigh` distribution object with the specified `sigma`.
5. **`rand(rayleigh_dist, num_samples)`:** Generates `num_samples` random numbers from the Rayleigh distribution.
6. **`pdf.(rayleigh_dist, x_values)`:** Calculates the PDF at each value in `x_values`. The `.` is crucial for broadcasting the `pdf` function over the array.
7. **`cdf.(rayleigh_dist, x_values)`:**  Calculates the CDF at each value in `x_values` using broadcasting.
8. **`histogram(...)`:** Creates a histogram of the random samples.  `density=true` normalizes the histogram.
9. **`plot!(...)`:** Adds the PDF curve to the existing plot. The `!` modifies the current plot.
10. **`plot(...)`:** Creates a new plot for the CDF.
11. **`mean(rayleigh_dist)`, `var(rayleigh_dist)`, etc.:** Calculate and print statistical properties of the distribution.
12. **`display(...)`:** Displays the created plots.  This is important, especially in environments where plots aren't displayed automatically.

This code will generate a histogram of random samples from the Rayleigh distribution, overlay the PDF, and create a separate plot of the CDF.  It also prints the mean, variance, mode, and median.  You can change the `sigma` value to see how the distribution changes.  Remember to install the `Distributions` and `Plots` packages if you haven't already (e.g., using `Pkg.add("Distributions")` and `Pkg.add("Plots")` in the Julia REPL).

### Worked Example

This code performs the following steps:

1. **Imports the `Distributions` package:** This package provides functions for working with various probability distributions in Julia.


```julia
using Distributions
```
2. **Defines the Weibull distribution parameters:** The `shape` and `scale` parameters are specified.


```julia
# Define the Weibull distribution parameters
shape = 2.0
scale = 3.0
```
3. **Creates a Weibull distribution object:** The `Weibull` function from the `Distributions` package is used to create a distribution object with the specified parameters.

```julia
# Create a Weibull distribution object
dist = Weibull(shape, scale)
```

4. **Generates random samples:** The `rand` function is used to generate a vector of random samples from the distribution.

```julia
# Generate random samples from the distribution
samples = rand(dist, 1000)
```



```julia
# Calculate the probability density function (PDF) at specific points
x_values = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
pdf_values = pdf.(dist, x_values)
```


5. **Calculates PDF, CDF, and quantile values:** The `pdf`, `cdf`, and `quantile` functions are used to calculate the probability density, cumulative distribution, and quantile values at specific points.

```julia
# Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at specific points
cdf_values = cdf.(dist, x_values)
```



```julia
# Calculate the quantile function (inverse CDF) at specific probabilities
probabilities = [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]
quantile_values = quantile.(dist, probabilities)
```

6. **Calculates mean and standard deviation:** The `mean` and `std` functions are used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.

```julia
# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the distribution
mean_dist = mean(dist)
std_dist = std(dist)
```


7. **Prints the results:** The calculated values are printed to the console.


```julia
# Print the results
println("Probability density function (PDF) at x = ", x_values, ": ", pdf_values)
println("Cumulative distribution function (CDF) at x = ", x_values, ": ", cdf_values)
println("Quantile function (inverse CDF) at probabilities = ", probabilities, ": ", quantile_values)
println("Mean of the distribution: ", mean_dist)
println("Standard deviation of the distribution: ", std_dist)
```



This example demonstrates the basic usage of the Weibull distribution in Julia. You can modify the parameters and perform other calculations as needed.

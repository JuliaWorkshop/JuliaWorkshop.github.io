# 1. Defining a Power Law Distribution

# The Distributions.jl package doesn't have a built-in Power Law distribution.
# We can define it ourselves.  Here's a simple implementation:

struct PowerLaw{T<:Real} <: ContinuousUnivariateDistribution
    xmin::T  # Minimum value (must be > 0)
    alpha::T # Exponent (must be > 1 for a proper distribution)
end

# Define a method to generate random samples.
import Base.rand
function rand(rng::AbstractRNG, d::PowerLaw)
    u = rand(rng)
    return d.xmin * (1 - u)^(-1/(d.alpha - 1))
end

# Define other necessary methods for Distributions.jl compatibility (optional but good practice).
import Distributions: pdf, cdf

function pdf(d::PowerLaw, x::Real)
    if x < d.xmin
        return 0.0
    else
        return (d.alpha - 1) * d.xmin^(d.alpha - 1) * x^(-d.alpha)
    end
end

function cdf(d::PowerLaw, x::Real)
    if x < d.xmin
        return 0.0
    else
        return 1 - (d.xmin / x)^(d.alpha - 1)
    end
end

# Example usage:
xmin = 1.0  # Minimum value
alpha = 2.5 # Exponent
dist = PowerLaw(xmin, alpha)

# 2. Generating Random Samples

n_samples = 10000
samples = rand(dist, n_samples)  # Generate random samples

# 3. Visualizing the Distribution

# Histogram
histogram(samples, 
          bins = : FreedmanDiaconis, #Good automatic bin selection
          normalize = true,
          xlabel = "x",
          ylabel = "Probability Density",
          title = "Power Law Distribution (xmin=$xmin, α=$alpha)")

# Overlay the theoretical PDF (for comparison)
x_vals = range(xmin, maximum(samples), length = 200)
plot!(x_vals, pdf.(dist, x_vals), 
      label = "Theoretical PDF", 
      linewidth = 2, 
      color = :red)


# Log-log plot (essential for power laws)
histogram(samples,
          bins = :log, # Logarithmic bins
          normalize = true,
          xlabel = "x (log scale)",
          ylabel = "Probability Density (log scale)",
          title = "Power Law Distribution (Log-Log Scale)",
          xscale = :log10, yscale = :log10)

plot!(x_vals, pdf.(dist, x_vals), 
      label = "Theoretical PDF", 
      linewidth = 2, 
      color = :red)

# 4. Parameter Estimation (Optional)

# Estimating parameters from data is more complex for power laws.
# There are specialized methods, but a simple (though not always best)
# approach is to use a linear fit on the log-log histogram.

# (Simplified example – more robust methods exist)
log_x = log.(samples)
log_counts = log.(fit(Histogram, samples, :log).weights)

# Fit a line to the log-log data (you would typically exclude the tail of the distribution).
# Note: This is a simplified example and might not be the most accurate estimation method.
#       More robust methods like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are recommended.
#       Packages like `PowerLaw` may be helpful for more advanced analysis.
#       However, MLE for power-law is a complex topic and requires specialized treatment.

# 5. Key Considerations for Power Laws

# - **Minimum Value (xmin):**  The minimum value is a crucial parameter.  Accurately determining xmin is important.
# - **Exponent (alpha):**  The exponent determines the shape of the distribution.
# - **Log-log plots:**  Essential for visualizing and analyzing power laws.  The power law appears as a straight line on a log-log plot.
# - **Parameter Estimation:**  Can be challenging.  Simple linear fits on log-log plots are a starting point but may not be accurate.  MLE is preferred but has its own complexities.  Be careful about binning effects.
# - **Heavy Tails:**  Power laws have "heavy tails," meaning extreme values are more likely than in many other distributions.  This has important implications for analysis and simulation.

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Custom `PowerLaw` Type:**  Since `Distributions.jl` doesn't have a built-in power law, we define our own `PowerLaw` struct and implement the necessary methods (`rand`, `pdf`, `cdf`). This makes it behave like other Distributions.jl distributions.

2. **Random Number Generation:** The `rand` method uses the inverse transform sampling method, which is the standard way to generate power-law random variates.

3. **PDF and CDF:**  The `pdf` and `cdf` methods are implemented for completeness and to allow comparison with the theoretical distribution.

4. **Visualization:**
   - The code now includes a regular histogram and a *log-log histogram*, which is absolutely essential for visualizing and confirming that your data follows a power law. Power laws appear as straight lines on a log-log plot.
   - The theoretical PDF is overlaid on the histogram for comparison.
   - `FreedmanDiaconis` is used for automatic bin selection which is generally a good choice.

5. **Parameter Estimation (Simplified):**  The code provides a *very* basic example of parameter estimation using a linear fit on the log-log histogram.  **Important:** This is a simplified example and may not be the most accurate method.  Power-law parameter estimation is a complex topic. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally preferred, but it's more involved.  The `PowerLaw` package may be helpful.

6. **Key Considerations:** The tutorial emphasizes the importance of `xmin`, `alpha`, log-log plots, and the challenges of parameter estimation for power laws.

7. **Clearer Comments and Structure:** The code is well-commented and organized, making it easier to follow.

8. **Package Loading:** Explicitly loads the necessary packages.

This improved tutorial provides a more complete and informative introduction to working with power-law distributions in Julia, covering definition, random number generation, visualization, and basic (though simplified) parameter estimation.  It also highlights the important considerations when dealing with power laws. Remember to install the necessary packages using `] add Distributions Plots StatsPlots` in the Julia REPL.

    * Fitting distributions to real-world failure data. Example: using MLE to estimate Weibull parameters from TTF data.
    * Goodness-of-fit (briefly): How to assess the fit of a distribution to data (e.g., visual inspection, QQ plots â€“ if time permits).

2. **Reliability Calculations (30 mins):**
    * Calculating the Reliability Function R(t): Julia code examples.
    * Calculating the Hazard Rate h(t): Julia code examples.
    * Mean Time To Failure (MTTF): Calculation and interpretation.
    * Examples: Calculating reliability and MTTF for different distributions and parameter values.

3. **Monte Carlo Simulation for Reliability (20 mins):**
    * Introduction to Monte Carlo methods.
    * Simulating system lifetimes using random samples from fitted distributions.
    * Estimating system reliability using Monte Carlo.
    * Example: Simulating a simple system with components in series or parallel.

**Julia Emphasis Throughout:**

* **Code Examples:** Provide plenty of clear and well-commented Julia code examples for each concept.
* **Hands-on Exercises:** Include short coding exercises during the sessions to reinforce learning.
* **Package Focus:** Emphasize the use of relevant Julia packages: `Distributions.jl`, `StatsPlots.jl`, `Optim.jl`, and potentially others like `SurvivalAnalysis.jl` for more advanced topics.
* **Real-World Data:** Use real or realistic datasets for parameter estimation and reliability calculations.
* **Plotting and Visualization:** Encourage students to visualize distributions, fitted models, and simulation results using `StatsPlots.jl`.

**Assessment:**

* Homework assignments involving coding and problem-solving related to reliability analysis.
* A final project where students apply the learned concepts to a more complex reliability problem.

**Further Exploration (Optional):**

* Bayesian Reliability Analysis (using `Turing.jl`).
* System Reliability Analysis (series/parallel systems, fault trees).
* Accelerated Life Testing.
* Introduction to `SurvivalAnalysis.jl` for survival analysis techniques.

**Key Advantages of using Julia:**

* **Performance:** Julia's performance is comparable to C/C++ or Fortran, making it suitable for computationally intensive simulations and analyses.
* **Ease of Use:** Julia's syntax is relatively easy to learn, especially for those familiar with other programming languages like Python or MATLAB.
* **Statistical Computing Ecosystem:** Julia has a growing ecosystem of packages for statistical computing, including `Distributions.jl`, `StatsPlots.jl`, `Optim.jl`, and others.
* **Open Source:** Julia is open-source and free to use.

This lesson plan provides a structured approach to teaching reliability analysis using Julia. The emphasis on hands-on coding and real-world examples will help students develop practical skills in this important area of engineering and data science.  The focus on Julia highlights its capabilities for this type of analysis, emphasizing its performance, ease of use, and strong statistical computing ecosystem.

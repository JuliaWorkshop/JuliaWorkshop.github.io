While `Distributions.jl` is the cornerstone for working with probability distributions in Julia, several other packages complement and extend its functionality, offering specialized tools and capabilities. Here are some notable examples:

**1. `StatsBase.jl`:**

* **Purpose:** Provides a wide range of statistical functions, including descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and more. While it doesn't define probability distributions themselves (that's `Distributions.jl`'s job), it works seamlessly with them.
* **Relevance to Distributions:**  `StatsBase.jl` offers functions like `countmap` (for frequency counts, useful with discrete distributions), `ecdf` (empirical cumulative distribution function), and tools for goodness-of-fit testing, which are often used in conjunction with `Distributions.jl`.

**2. `FreqTables.jl`:**

* **Purpose:**  Specifically designed for creating frequency tables and contingency tables.
* **Relevance to Distributions:**  When dealing with discrete data or categorical data that can be represented as discrete distributions, `FreqTables.jl` is incredibly useful for summarizing and analyzing the data before fitting a distribution.

**3. `SurvivalAnalysis.jl`:**

* **Purpose:**  Focuses on survival analysis, a branch of statistics that deals with time-to-event data (often related to reliability and failure analysis).
* **Relevance to Distributions:**  `SurvivalAnalysis.jl` builds upon the foundation provided by `Distributions.jl` and provides tools for survival curves (Kaplan-Meier estimator), hazard rates, and parametric survival models (which often use distributions from `Distributions.jl`).

**4. `MCMCChains.jl` and `Turing.jl`:**

* **Purpose:**  For Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. `MCMCChains.jl` provides tools for working with MCMC chains, and `Turing.jl` is a probabilistic programming language that makes it easy to define and sample from complex Bayesian models.
* **Relevance to Distributions:**  In Bayesian statistics, prior distributions are essential, and these are often defined using distributions from `Distributions.jl`.  `Turing.jl` uses `Distributions.jl` for defining these priors and the likelihood functions in Bayesian models.

**5. `Measurements.jl`:**

* **Purpose:**  Handles uncertainty in numerical values.
* **Relevance to Distributions:**  When dealing with parameters of probability distributions that have some uncertainty associated with them (e.g., due to measurement error), `Measurements.jl` can be used to propagate that uncertainty through calculations involving the distributions.

**6. `UncertainData.jl`:**

* **Purpose:** Similar to `Measurements.jl` but with a focus on representing uncertainty through probability distributions.
* **Relevance to Distributions:** `UncertainData.jl` allows you to create uncertain data types where the uncertainty is represented by a probability distribution. This is powerful for simulations and sensitivity analysis.

**7. `Distances.jl`:**

* **Purpose:**  Provides functions for calculating various distance metrics.
* **Relevance to Distributions:**  While not directly related to defining distributions, distance metrics are sometimes used when comparing probability distributions or in certain statistical methods that involve distributions.

**8. `KernelDensity.jl`:**

* **Purpose:** For kernel density estimation, a non-parametric method for estimating the probability density function of a random variable.
* **Relevance to Distributions:** Kernel density estimation can be used as an alternative to fitting parametric distributions (like those in `Distributions.jl`) when the underlying distribution is unknown or complex.

**9. `Bijectors.jl`:**

* **Purpose:** Provides tools for creating and manipulating bijective transformations, which are useful for constructing new probability distributions from existing ones.
* **Relevance to Distributions:** Can be used to create more complex or specialized distributions that are not directly available in `Distributions.jl`.

**Example: Combining `Distributions.jl` and `StatsBase.jl`**

```julia
using Distributions, StatsBase

data = rand(Normal(0, 1), 1000)

# Calculate descriptive statistics
mean_data = mean(data)
std_data = std(data)

# Create an ECDF
ecdf_data = ecdf(data)

# Fit a Normal distribution (using MLE - example, Optim.jl would be better)
# (Simplified example - in real code, use Optim.jl for MLE)
fitted_normal = Normal(mean_data, std_data)

# Compare the ECDF to the fitted CDF
using Plots
plot(ecdf_data, label="ECDF")
x_vals = range(minimum(data), maximum(data), length=100)
plot!(x_vals, cdf.(fitted_normal, x_vals), label="Fitted Normal CDF")
```

In summary, while `Distributions.jl` is your primary source for probability distributions, these other packages offer valuable tools for statistical analysis, data manipulation, visualization, and specialized tasks like survival analysis and Bayesian modeling, all of which often work in concert with `Distributions.jl`.  The choice of which package to use depends on the specific needs of your project.

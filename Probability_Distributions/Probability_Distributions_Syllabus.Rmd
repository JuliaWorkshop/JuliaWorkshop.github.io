### Supported Distributions**

The Distributions.jl package in Julia supports a wide variety of probability distributions, including:

* **Univariate Distributions:**
    * Continuous: Normal, Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, Beta, Cauchy, Chi-squared, F, t, Weibull, and many more.
    * Discrete: Binomial, Poisson, Bernoulli, Geometric, Negative Binomial, and more.
* **Multivariate Distributions:**
    * Multinomial, Multivariate Normal, Dirichlet, Wishart, and others.
* **Matrix-variate Distributions:**
    * Matrix Normal, Matrix T, and others.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The package also provides tools for working with:

* **Truncated and Censored Distributions:** Create distributions with restricted support.
* **Mixture Models:** Combine multiple distributions.
* **Product Distributions:** Create distributions from independent random variables.
* **Order Statistics:** Work with the k-th smallest value from a sample.

You can find a comprehensive list of supported distributions and their properties in the Distributions.jl documentation: [https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/)

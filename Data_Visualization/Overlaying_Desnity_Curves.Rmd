using Plots

# 1. Generate some data from a distribution (e.g., Normal)
mu = 0
sigma = 1
data = rand(Normal(mu, sigma), 1000)

# 2. Create the histogram
histogram(data, 
          bins = 50, # Adjust the number of bins as needed
          normalize = true, # Important: Normalize to get a density
          label = "Histogram",
          xlabel = "Data Value",
          ylabel = "Density",
          alpha = 0.6, # Adjust transparency for better visualization
          color = :blue)

# 3. Create the density curve
x_values = range(minimum(data), maximum(data), length = 200) # Range for the curve
distribution = Normal(mu, sigma) # The distribution you used to generate data
density_values = pdf.(distribution, x_values)

plot!(x_values, density_values, 
      label = "Density Curve",
      color = :red,
      linewidth = 2)

# 4. (Optional) Add title and legend
title!("Histogram with Density Curve Overlay")

# Display or save the plot
display(plot!)
#savefig("histogram_density.png") # Uncomment to save as a PNG
```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Normalization:** The crucial part is `normalize = true` within the `histogram()` function.  This ensures that the histogram represents a *probability density*, not just counts.  Without normalization, the histogram's scale won't match the density curve.

2. **Number of Bins:**  The `bins` parameter controls the granularity of the histogram.  Experiment with different values (e.g., 30, 75, 100) to find a good balance. Too few bins can obscure the shape, while too many can make the histogram look noisy.

3. **Range for Density Curve:** The `x_values` for plotting the density curve are now calculated based on the `minimum` and `maximum` of your actual data. This ensures the curve covers the relevant range. The `length` parameter controls the smoothness of the curve.

4. **Distribution Object:**  The code now explicitly creates a `distribution` object (e.g., `Normal(mu, sigma)`). This is more robust and allows you to easily change the distribution if needed.  Make sure this matches the distribution you used to generate the data (or the distribution you're trying to fit if you're working with real-world data).

5. **Transparency (alpha):**  The `alpha` parameter in `histogram()` makes the histogram slightly transparent.  This makes it easier to see the density curve underneath, especially where the histogram bars are dense.

6. **Labels and Title:** Clear labels and a title make the plot more informative.

7. **Saving the Plot:** The commented-out line `savefig("histogram_density.png")` shows how to save the plot to a file if you need to.

**How to Use with Real-World Data:**

If you have real-world data, you'll need to:

1. **Load your data:**  Use a package like `CSV.jl` or `DataFrames.jl` to read your data into Julia.
2. **Fit a distribution (optional):** If you don't know the underlying distribution, you might need to fit one to your data using functions like `fit_mle()` (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) or other fitting methods.  This will give you the parameters for the distribution you're fitting.
3. **Use the fitted distribution:**  Use the *fitted* distribution in the `pdf()` function when plotting the density curve.

**Example with Real Data (Illustrative):**

```julia
# ... (Load your data into a vector called 'data') ...

# Example: Fitting a Normal distribution (you might need a different one)
fitted_dist = fit_mle(Normal, data)

# ... (Rest of the plotting code as above, but use 'fitted_dist' 
#      instead of 'Normal(mu, sigma)' for the density curve) ...
density_values = pdf.(fitted_dist, x_values) # Use the fitted distribution

# ... (The rest of the plotting code is the same)
```

Remember to choose the appropriate distribution to fit your data.  If the Normal distribution isn't a good fit, explore other distributions in `Distributions.jl`.  You might also want to look into kernel density estimation (KDE) if you don't want to assume a specific parametric distribution.  Packages like `KernelDensity.jl` can help with KDE.

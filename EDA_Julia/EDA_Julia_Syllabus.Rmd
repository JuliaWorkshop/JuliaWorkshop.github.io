**Course Description:**

This 12-week course will provide a comprehensive introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Julia programming language. EDA is a crucial initial step in any data science project, involving the in-depth investigation of a dataset to summarize its key characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify anomalies. Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and a final project, students will develop a strong foundation in EDA techniques and their practical application.

**Prerequisites:**

* Basic programming experience (e.g., understanding of variables, control flow, functions).
* Familiarity with basic statistical concepts (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
* A computer with Julia and the necessary packages installed.

**Software:**

* Julia programming language
* Julia packages: DataFrames.jl, Plots.jl, Statistics.jl, Missing.jl, HypothesisTests.jl (for statistical tests)

**Grading:**

* **Assignments:** [Percentage] (e.g., 40%) - Weekly assignments covering the course material.
* **Midterm Exam:** [Percentage] (e.g., 25%) - In-class or take-home exam covering the first half of the course.
* **Final Project:** [Percentage] (e.g., 35%) - A comprehensive project applying EDA techniques to a real-world dataset and presenting findings.

**Course Schedule:**

        * Creating and interpreting Bland-Altman plots in Julia
        * Assessing agreement between two measurement methods
        * Calculating limits of agreement
    * Case study: Analyzing a dataset involving two measurement methods (e.g., comparing blood pressure measurements from two different devices)

**Module 6: Midterm Exam & Case Study (Weeks 10-11)**

* **Week 10:** 
    * Midterm Exam (covering Modules 1-5)
    * Introduction to a case study: Analyzing a real-world dataset 
* **Week 11:** 
    * In-depth analysis of the case study dataset: 
        * Applying EDA techniques learned in the course
        * Identifying key findings and insights

**Module 7: Final Project & Presentations (Week 12)**

* **Week 12:** 
    * Final Project: Students select and analyze their own datasets
    * Guidance and support for final project development
    * Final Project Presentations: Students present their findings to the class
    * Course wrap-up and Q&A session

**Textbook (Optional):**

* A recommended textbook on statistical data analysis or a Julia-specific data science book.

**Note:**

* This is a sample syllabus and may be adjusted based on the specific needs and goals of the course.
* The instructor reserves the right to make changes to the syllabus as needed.

This revised syllabus now includes a dedicated week for Method Comparison Studies, with a focus on Bland-Altman plots. This will provide students with valuable skills in assessing the agreement between different measurement methods, which is crucial in many scientific and clinical applications.

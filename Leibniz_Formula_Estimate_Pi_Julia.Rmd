Here is the implementation of the Leibniz formula for approximating π using the Julia programming language:

This implementation provides a straightforward way to approximate π using the Leibniz formula in Julia. Keep in mind that the Leibniz formula converges very slowly, so you may need a large number of terms for an accurate approximation. Other methods for calculating π can converge much faster.





```julia
# Number of terms to use in the approximation
terms = 100000

# Generate the sequence of denominators (1, 3, 5, 7, ...)
denominators = 1 .+ 2 .* (0:(terms-1))

# Create the alternating signs (+1, -1, +1, -1, ...)
signs = (-1) .^ (0:(terms-1))

# Calculate the terms of the series (sign / denominator)
terms_of_series = signs ./ denominators

# Sum the terms of the series
sum_of_series = sum(terms_of_series)

# Multiply by 4 to get the approximation of π
pi_approximation = 4 * sum_of_series

# Display the result
println("Approximated value of π: ", pi_approximation)
```

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. **Number of Terms:** Sets the number of terms to be used in the approximation.
2. **Generating Denominators:** Generates the sequence of odd denominators.
3. **Alternating Signs:** Creates the alternating sequence of +1 and -1.
4. **Calculating Terms:** Divides each sign by the corresponding denominator.
5. **Summing Terms:** Sums all the terms of the series.
6. **Approximating Pi:** Multiplies the sum by 4 to approximate the value of π.
7. **Displaying Result:** Prints the approximated value of π.

## Tidyverse with Julia: A Lesson Plan (8 x 1-hour Classes)

This lesson plan focuses on teaching the core concepts and functionality of the Tidyverse (specifically focusing on its equivalent packages and philosophy) within the Julia programming language.  It emphasizes hands-on practice and real-world examples to make learning engaging and effective.

**Overall Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand the Tidyverse philosophy of data manipulation.
* Use key Julia packages for data wrangling, visualization, and tidying.
* Perform common data manipulation tasks efficiently and elegantly.
* Create informative and visually appealing data visualizations.
* Apply these skills to solve real-world data analysis problems.

**Target Audience:**  Beginner to intermediate Julia programmers who want to learn data manipulation and visualization techniques.

**Software:** Julia (latest version), relevant Julia packages (DataFrames.jl, CSV.jl, Plots.jl, Gadfly.jl, Tidier.jl, etc.)

**Lesson 1: Introduction to Tidy Data and DataFrames.jl (1 hour)**

* **Topics:**
    * The principles of tidy data (each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, each type of observational unit forms a table).
    * Introduction to DataFrames.jl: creating, inspecting, and manipulating data frames.
    * Reading and writing data from CSV files using CSV.jl.
* **Examples/Exercises:**
    * Convert a messy dataset (e.g., a table with combined columns) into tidy format.
    * Import a CSV file containing sales data and explore its structure.
    * Create a new DataFrame by selecting specific columns from an existing one.

**Lesson 2: Data Transformation with DataFrames.jl (1 hour)**

* **Topics:**
    * `select()`: Choosing columns.
    * `filter()`: Selecting rows based on conditions.
    * `mutate()`: Creating new columns or modifying existing ones.
    * `rename()`: Renaming columns.
* **Examples/Exercises:**
    * Filter a dataset of customer information to find customers in a specific region.
    * Create a new column calculating the total price based on quantity and unit price.
    * Rename columns in a dataset to be more descriptive.

**Lesson 3: Data Aggregation and Grouping with DataFrames.jl (1 hour)**

* **Topics:**
    * `groupby()`: Grouping data by one or more columns.
    * `summarize()`: Calculating summary statistics for groups.
    * Combining `groupby()` and `summarize()` for powerful data aggregation.
* **Examples/Exercises:**
    * Calculate the average sales per product category.
    * Find the top 10 customers with the highest total purchases.
    * Calculate the number of observations in each group.

**Lesson 4: Data Joining and Combining with DataFrames.jl (1 hour)**

* **Topics:**
    * `innerjoin()`, `leftjoin()`, `rightjoin()`, `outerjoin()`: Joining data frames based on common columns.
    * `vcat()`: Combining data frames vertically.
* **Examples/Exercises:**
    * Join two datasets, one containing customer information and the other containing order details.
    * Combine data from multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame.
    * Perform different types of joins (inner, left, right) and observe the results.

**Lesson 5: Introduction to Data Visualization with Plots.jl (1 hour)**

* **Topics:**
    * Basic plotting with Plots.jl: scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, histograms.
    * Customizing plots: adding titles, labels, legends, themes.
    * Creating visualizations from DataFrames.
* **Examples/Exercises:**
    * Create a scatter plot of sales vs. advertising spend.
    * Plot the trend of sales over time.
    * Create a bar chart showing the distribution of customers by region.

**Lesson 6: Advanced Visualization with Plots.jl (1 hour)**

* **Topics:**
    * Faceting: Creating multiple plots based on different groups.
    * Advanced plot types: box plots, violin plots, heatmaps.
    * Combining multiple plots into a single figure.
* **Examples/Exercises:**
    * Create a faceted plot showing the sales trend for each product category.
    * Visualize the distribution of customer ages using a box plot.
    * Create a heatmap showing the correlation between different variables.

**Lesson 7:  Introduction to Gadfly.jl (1 hour)**

* **Topics:**
    * The Grammar of Graphics and its implementation in Gadfly.jl
    * Layers, aesthetics, geoms, and scales.
    * Creating complex and customized visualizations.
* **Examples/Exercises:**
    * Recreate visualizations from the previous lesson using Gadfly.jl.
    * Explore different geoms and aesthetics to create unique visualizations.
    * Create a layered plot with multiple geoms.

**Lesson 8: Putting it all together: A mini data analysis project (1 hour)**

* **Topics:**
    * Applying the learned skills to a real-world dataset.
    * Working through a small data analysis project, from data cleaning and transformation to visualization and interpretation.
    * Best practices for data analysis and visualization.
* **Examples/Exercises:**
    * Analyze a dataset of movie ratings, including cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data.
    * Analyze a dataset of weather data, including calculating summary statistics and creating visualizations.
    * Students work on a small project of their own choosing.

**Throughout the lessons:**

* Emphasize the "pipe" (`|>`) operator for chaining data manipulation operations.
* Encourage students to explore the documentation and examples for each package.
* Provide real-world datasets for exercises and projects.
* Foster a collaborative learning environment.

This detailed lesson plan provides a solid foundation in the Tidyverse principles and their application within Julia. By combining theoretical explanations with hands-on exercises and real-world examples, students will gain valuable skills in data manipulation and visualization. Remember to adapt the pace and content based on your students' background and learning progress.

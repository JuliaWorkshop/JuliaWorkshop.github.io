It looks like you're sharing some useful information about the `range()` function in Julia. This function is incredibly handy for creating sequences of values with different configurations. Here's a brief summary of what you shared:

1. **Range with a Specific Length and Stop**:
   - Example: `range(1, length=12, stop=100)` creates a range from 1 to 100 in exactly 12 steps.
   - Output: `1.0:9.0:100.0`.

2. **Range with a Specific Step and Stop**:
   - Example: `range(1, stop=100, step=10)` creates a range from 1, taking steps of 10, up to or before 100.
   - Output: `1:10:91`.

3. **Converting Range to an Array**:
   - Use `collect()` to convert a range object to an array.
   - Example: `collect(range(1, length=12, stop=100))` creates an array with 12 elements from 1 to 100.

4. **Logarithmic Ranges**:
   - Create a range in log space by broadcasting the `exp10` function.
   - Example: `exp10.(range(2.0, stop=3.0, length=5))` creates an array with values from \(10^2\) to \(10^3\).

5. **Finding Step Size**:
   - Use `step()` on a range object to find the step size.
   - Example: `step(range(1, length=10, stop=100))` gives `11.0`.

6. **Range with Specific Step and Length**:
   - Example: `range(1, step=3, length=20) |> collect` creates an array with 20 elements, starting from 1 and stepping by 3.

This functionality is quite powerful and flexible for generating sequences of numbers in Julia! If you need any specific assistance or have more questions about using Julia, feel free to ask.

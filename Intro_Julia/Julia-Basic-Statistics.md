Statistics with Julia
========================================================


### Statistics with Julia
JuliaStats is a meta-project which consolidates various packages related to statistics and machine learning in Julia. Well worth taking a look if you plan on working in this domain.

julia> x = rand(10);
julia> mean(x)
0.5287191472784906
julia> std(x)
0.2885446536178459

Julia already has some builtin support for statistical operations, so additional packages are not strictly necessary. However they do increase the scope and ease of possible operations (as we'll see below).Julia already has some builtin support for statistical operations. Let's kick off by loading all the packages that we'll be looking at today.

julia> using StatsBase, StatsFuns, StreamStats
StatsBase

The documentation for StatsBase can be found here. As the package name implies, it provides support for basic statistical operations in Julia.

High level summary statistics are generated by summarystats().

julia> summarystats(x)
Summary Stats:
Mean:         0.528719
Minimum:      0.064803
1st Quartile: 0.317819
Median:       0.529662
3rd Quartile: 0.649787
Maximum:      0.974760

Weighted versions of the mean, variance and standard deviation are implemented. There're also geometric and harmonic means.

julia> w = WeightVec(rand(1:10, 10));      # A weight vector.
julia> mean(x, w)                          # Weighted mean.
0.48819933297961043
julia> var(x, w)                           # Weighted variance.
0.08303843715334995
julia> std(x, w)                           # Weighted standard deviation.

There's a weighted median as well as functions for calculating quantiles.

What is a DataFrame?
A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure that can have columns of different types.

You can see a DataFrame as an Excel sheet.

You can load datasets in your DataFrame memory structure from other Julia buitin structures or persistent storage such as Excel, CSV and SQL database.

Let's consider this example tabular data contructed using Google Spreadsheets:

Julia DataFrame Example
==================================================
We have three columns - Name, Title and Salary and six rows.

Let's now see how we can construct a Julia DataFrame from this table.

Creating a Julia DataFrame from Vectors
===============================================
From our example, we can see that each column can be seen as a Vector.

The first vector is Name = ["N1", "N2", "N3", "N4", "N5", "N6"]


 
The second vector is Title = ["Engineer", "Developer", "Designer", "DB Administrator", "Mobile Developer", "Data Scientist"]

The third vector is Salary = [20000, 30000, 25000, 26000, 30000, 40000]

Note: Just like Mathematics, In Julia a Vector is a special type of Matrix that has only one row (row matrix) or one column (column matrix).

This is also called a 1D-Array

Just like most programming languages you use arrays in Julia for creating ordered collections of elements. In Julia you can use the square brackets and commas to create arrays.

In Julia, you can use arrays for representing lists, vectors, tables, and matrices.

Head back to your Julia interpeter and run the following code

julia> using DataFrames
julia> df = DataFrame(Name =  ["N1", "N2", "N3", "N4", "N5", "N6"], Title =  ["Engineer", "Developer", "Designer", "DB Administrator", "Mobile Developer", "Data Scientist"], Salary =  [20000, 30000, 25000, 26000, 30000, 40000])
We create a DataFrame from our previous vectors (or arrays).

You should get the following output:

6×3 DataFrame
??? Row ??? Name   ??? Title            ??? Salary ???
???     ??? String ??? String           ??? Int64  ???
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??? 1   ??? N1     ??? Engineer         ??? 20000  ???
??? 2   ??? N2     ??? Developer        ??? 30000  ???
??? 3   ??? N3     ??? Designer         ??? 25000  ???
??? 4   ??? N4     ??? DB Administrator ??? 26000  ???
??? 5   ??? N5     ??? Mobile Developer ??? 30000  ???
??? 6   ??? N6     ??? Data Scientist   ??? 40000  ???

This means we created a DataFrame with six rows and three columns. It's exactly our table in the spreadsheet!

Julia DataFrame Example
============================================
Creating a Julia DataFrame from Dictionaries
You can use Dict to create a dictionary in Julia. Given a single iterable argument, let's construct a Dict whose key-value pairs are taken from 2-tuples (key,value).

Examples
julia> Dict([("A", 1), ("B", 2)])
  Dict{String,Int64} with 2 entries:
    "B" => 2
    "A" => 1
Alternatively, a sequence of pair arguments may be passed.

julia> Dict("A"=>1, "B"=>2)
  Dict{String,Int64} with 2 entries:
    "B" => 2
    "A" => 1

 
Let's now see how we can contruct our previous DataFrame from our example table.

Let's first define our pairs:

The first pair is "Name" => ["N1", "N2", "N3", "N4", "N5", "N6"]

The second pair is "Title" => ["Engineer", "Developer", "Designer", "DB Administrator", "Mobile Developer", "Data Scientist"]

The third pair is "Salary" => [20000, 30000, 25000, 26000, 30000, 40000]

In you terminal run the following code to create a DataFrame from a Dict:

julia> df = DataFrame(Dict("Name" =>  ["N1", "N2", "N3", "N4", "N5", "N6"], "Title" =>  ["Engineer", "Developer", "Designer", "DB Administrator", "Mobile Developer", "Data Scientist"], "Salary" =>  [20000, 30000, 25000, 26000, 30000, 40000]))
Again, we get the following output:

6×3 DataFrame
??? Row ??? Name   ??? Salary ??? Title            ???
???     ??? String ??? Int64  ??? String           ???
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??? 1   ??? N1     ??? 20000  ??? Engineer         ???
??? 2   ??? N2     ??? 30000  ??? Developer        ???
??? 3   ??? N3     ??? 25000  ??? Designer         ???
??? 4   ??? N4     ??? 26000  ??? DB Administrator ???
??? 5   ??? N5     ??? 30000  ??? Mobile Developer ???
??? 6   ??? N6     ??? 40000  ??? Data Scientist   ???


Reading and Writing CSV Files
===============================================
We can use ths CSV.jl package to read and write CSV files.

Head back to your julia terminal and import CSV.jl using the following code:

julia> using Pkg
Pkg.add("CSV")
This will download and install the CSV package and its dependencies.

Next, import the CSV methods using the following code:

julia> using CSV
Writing a DataFrame to CSV
Next, let's write our previous DataFrame to a data.csv file using the following code:

julia> CSV.write("data.csv", df)
"data.csv"
You should find the data.csv file in your current directory from which you invoked julia.

Reading a CSV File
======================================
You can read a CSV file using the CSV.read() method. Let's read our data.csv file back using the following code:

julia> CSV.read("data.csv")
The result is a DataFrame as follows:

6×3 DataFrame
??? Row ??? Name    ??? Salary ??? Title            ???
???     ??? String??? ??? Int64??? ??? String???          ???
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??? 1   ??? N1      ??? 20000  ??? Engineer         ???
??? 2   ??? N2      ??? 30000  ??? Developer        ???
??? 3   ??? N3      ??? 25000  ??? Designer         ???
??? 4   ??? N4      ??? 26000  ??? DB Administrator ???
??? 5   ??? N5      ??? 30000  ??? Mobile Developer ???
??? 6   ??? N6      ??? 40000  ??? Data Scientist   ???
Conclusion
In this tutorial we introduced you to data science with the Julia programming language. We have seen what's data science and how to install Julia in Ubuntu then seen the definition of the DataFrame structure and how to create a DataFrame from our example tabular data using the DataFrames package.

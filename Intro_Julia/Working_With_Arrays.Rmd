###Working With Arrays

Let's dive into some of the most commonly used array manipulation functions in Julia. 

Hereâ€™s a tutorial on how to use `push!`, `pop!`, `shift!`, and `unshift!` along with some similar commands.

## `push!` and `pop!`

### `push!`
The `push!` function is used to append elements to the end of an array.

```julia
# Example
arr = [1, 2, 3]
push!(arr, 4) # arr becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### `pop!`
The `pop!` function removes the last element from the array and returns it.

```julia
# Example
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
last_element = pop!(arr) # arr becomes [1, 2, 3], last_element is 4
```

## `shift!` and `unshift!`

### `shift!`
The `shift!` function removes the first element of the array and returns it.

```julia
# Example
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
first_element = shift!(arr) # arr becomes [2, 3, 4], first_element is 1
```

### `unshift!`
The `unshift!` function is used to insert an element at the beginning of an array.

```julia
# Example
arr = [2, 3, 4]
unshift!(arr, 1) # arr becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Similar Commands

### `append!`
The `append!` function is used to concatenate two arrays, appending the elements of one array to another.

```julia
# Example
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [4, 5, 6]
append!(arr1, arr2) # arr1 becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### `splice!`
The `splice!` function removes a range of elements from an array and can optionally replace them with another collection of elements.

```julia
# Example
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
splice!(arr, 2:4) # arr becomes [1, 5], removed elements are [2, 3, 4]
splice!(arr, 2:2, [8, 9]) # arr becomes [1, 8, 9, 5]
```

### `insert!`
The `insert!` function is used to insert an element at a specified position in the array.

```julia
# Example
arr = [1, 3, 4]
insert!(arr, 2, 2) # arr becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Conclusion
These commands provide a robust set of tools for manipulating arrays in Julia. By mastering these, you can efficiently handle and transform array data to suit your needs.

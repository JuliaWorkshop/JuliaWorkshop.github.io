Yes, Julia has an equivalent to the R function `replicate`. In Julia, you can use the `map` function along with a range or array to achieve similar functionality. Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use it:

```julia
# Define a function that you want to replicate
f(x) = x^2

# Use map to replicate the function f multiple times
n = 10  # Number of replications
results = map(x -> f(x), 1:n)

# Or using a more concise way
results = [f(x) for x in 1:n]
```

This will generate an array of results by applying the function `f` to the integers from 1 to `n`. If you need to replicate a more complex expression or a function call that doesn't take arguments, you can use an anonymous function or `do` block with `map`.

For example, to replicate a random number generation:

```julia
# Use map with an anonymous function
n = 10  # Number of replications
random_numbers = map(x -> rand(), 1:n)

# Or using a list comprehension
random_numbers = [rand() for _ in 1:n]
```

This will generate an array of 10 random numbers.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification.

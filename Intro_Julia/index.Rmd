### Introduction to Julia

<h3> Introduction to Programming with Julia for Maths, Science & Engineering Students</h3>

- Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. 
- It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.

- The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. 
- In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Juliab

### Syllabus

<h3> Introduction to Programming with Julia for Maths, Science & Engineering Students</h3>


**Course Description:**

This course introduces fundamental programming concepts and techniques using the Julia language, specifically tailored for students in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. Through a blend of lectures, hands-on exercises, and practical projects, students will gain a solid foundation in programming principles and their application to solve problems in their respective fields.

**Prerequisites:**

* Basic familiarity with mathematical concepts (e.g., algebra, functions)
* No prior programming experience required

**Software:**

* Julia programming language
* Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
* Jupyter Notebooks (optional, but highly recommended)

**Grading:**

* **Assignments:** [Percentage] (e.g., 50%) - Weekly assignments covering the course material.
* **Midterm Exam:** [Percentage] (e.g., 25%) - In-class or take-home exam covering the first half of the course.
* **Final Project:** [Percentage] (e.g., 25%) - A project applying programming concepts to a problem relevant to your field of study.

## Installing Julia

(<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>)

Here's a short tutorial on installing Julia, along with instructions for setting up Jupyter Notebooks and IJulia.jl.

### Installing Julia
1. **Download Julia:**
   - Head over to the [official Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and download the latest stable release for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install Julia:**
   - **Windows:** Run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation prompts.
   - **macOS:** Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag Julia to the Applications folder.
   - **Linux:** Extract the downloaded `.tar.gz` file and follow the instructions in the README file to install Julia.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and type `julia` to launch the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). You should see the Julia prompt (`julia>`).

### Installing Jupyter Notebooks and IJulia.jl
1. **Install Jupyter:**
   - You'll need to have Python and pip installed. If you don't have them, install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Once Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Jupyter:
     ```sh
     pip install jupyter
     ```

2. **Install IJulia.jl:**
   - Open the Julia REPL by typing `julia` in your terminal or command prompt.
   - Add the IJulia package by running the following commands in the Julia REPL:
     ```julia
     import Pkg
     Pkg.add("IJulia")
     ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   - After installing IJulia, you can launch Jupyter Notebook from the Julia REPL by running:
     ```julia
     using IJulia
     notebook()
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal or command prompt by running:
     ```sh
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser. You can create a new notebook and select `Julia` as the kernel.

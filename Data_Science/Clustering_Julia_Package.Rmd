The `Clustering.jl` package is a powerful tool in Julia for performing data clustering. It covers two main aspects of data clustering: clustering algorithms and clustering comparison & evaluation.

### Clustering Algorithms
`Clustering.jl` implements a variety of clustering algorithms, including:
- **K-means**: A popular algorithm for partitioning data into k clusters.
- **K-medoids**: Similar to K-means but uses medoids instead of centroids.
- **Affinity Propagation**: Clusters data by sending messages between data points.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, useful for finding clusters of varying shapes and sizes.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters using methods like single linkage, complete linkage, and Ward's linkage.
- **Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL)**: Clusters data based on flow simulation.
- **Fuzzy C-means**: Allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.

### Clustering Comparison & Evaluation
The package also provides tools for comparing and evaluating clustering results, such as:
- **Cross-tabulation**: Compares clustering results with ground truth labels.
- **Variational and Mutual Information**: Measures the similarity between different clustering results.
- **Intrinsic Clustering Quality Indices**: Includes metrics like silhouette scores to evaluate the quality of clustering.

### Usage
Most clustering functions in `Clustering.jl` have a similar interface, making it easy to switch between different algorithms. The package accepts input data in the form of a data matrix or a distance matrix, and provides options to control the iterations and convergence criteria.

### Results
The output of a clustering function is typically an instance of a `ClusteringResult` subtype, which contains both the resulting clustering (e.g., assignments of points to clusters) and information about the clustering algorithm (e.g., number of iterations, convergence status).

## Linear Mixed Effects Models in Julia: A 14-Week Syllabus

**Course Description:** This course provides a comprehensive introduction to linear mixed effects models (LMEMs) and their implementation using the Julia programming language. LMEMs are powerful statistical tools for analyzing data with hierarchical or clustered structures, common in various fields like biology, psychology, and engineering.  Students will learn the theoretical foundations of LMEMs, model specification, parameter estimation, model diagnostics, interpretation of results, and specialized applications including method comparison studies. The course emphasizes practical application through hands-on coding exercises and real-world datasets.

**Prerequisites:**  Basic knowledge of linear regression, statistical inference, and familiarity with programming concepts (ideally in any language).  Prior experience with Julia is beneficial but not required.  A brief introduction to Julia will be provided in the first week.

**Course Objectives:** Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand the theoretical underpinnings of linear mixed effects models.
* Formulate appropriate LMEMs for various data structures.
* Implement and fit LMEMs using the `MixedModels.jl` package in Julia.
* Interpret model outputs and assess model fit.
* Perform model comparison and selection.
* Apply LMEMs to analyze real-world datasets, including method comparison studies.
* Understand the specific challenges and considerations in analyzing method comparison data.
* Communicate results effectively.

**Software:** Julia (version 1.9 or later recommended),  `MixedModels.jl`, `DataFrames.jl`, `Plots.jl`, and other relevant Julia packages.  Instructions for installation and setup will be provided.

**Assessment:**

* **Homework Assignments (40%):**  Regular assignments involving data analysis and model interpretation using LMEMs in Julia, including assignments focused on method comparison.
* **Midterm Exam (30%):**  Covers the theoretical concepts and practical application of LMEMs from the first half of the course.
* **Final Project (30%):**  Students will work on a data analysis project using LMEMs, potentially focusing on a method comparison study, culminating in a written report and a short presentation.

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with Julia: A Syllabus

**Course Description:** This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and their implementation using the Julia programming language.  GLMs extend ordinary linear regression by allowing the response variable to have a non-normal distribution and by linking the mean of the response to the predictors through a link function. This course covers the theoretical foundations of GLMs, including maximum likelihood estimation, model diagnostics, and hypothesis testing, as well as practical applications using Julia packages like `GLM.jl` and `StatsModels.jl`.

**Prerequisites:**

* Basic knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.
* Familiarity with the Julia programming language (or willingness to learn quickly).  A brief introductory Julia session can be included at the start of the course.

**Course Objectives:** Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand the theoretical foundations of GLMs.
* Identify appropriate GLM families and link functions for different types of data.
* Implement and fit GLMs using Julia packages.
* Perform model diagnostics and assess model fit.
* Conduct hypothesis tests and interpret results in the context of GLMs.
* Apply GLMs to solve real-world problems in various domains.

**Course Outline:**

**Module 1: Introduction to GLMs (2 weeks)**

* Review of linear regression.
* Motivation for GLMs: limitations of ordinary linear regression.
* The three components of a GLM:
    * Random component: Exponential family distributions (Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, etc.).
    * Systematic component: Linear predictor.
    * Link function: Connecting the random and systematic components.
* Examples of GLMs and their applications.
* Introduction to Julia packages for GLMs: `GLM.jl`, `StatsModels.jl`.

**Module 2: Model Fitting and Estimation (3 weeks)**

* Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for GLM parameters.
* Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm.
* Model fitting in Julia using `glm()` from `GLM.jl`.
* Working with different link functions in Julia.
* Interpreting model coefficients.

**Module 3: Model Diagnostics and Assessment (3 weeks)**

* Residual analysis: deviance residuals, Pearson residuals.
* Assessing goodness of fit: deviance, Pearson chi-squared statistic.
* Overdispersion and its handling.
* Model comparison and selection using AIC and BIC.
* Diagnostics plots and their interpretation.
* Implementing diagnostics in Julia.

**Module 4: Hypothesis Testing and Inference (2 weeks)**

* Hypothesis testing for GLM parameters: Wald tests, Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRTs).
* Confidence intervals for GLM parameters.
* ANOVA for GLMs.
* Performing hypothesis tests and calculating confidence intervals in Julia.
* Interpreting results in the context of the problem.

**Module 5: Advanced Topics and Applications (2 weeks)**

* Quasi-likelihood estimation for overdispersion.
* Robust GLMs for handling outliers.
* Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) â€“ a brief introduction.
* Applications of GLMs in different fields (e.g., ecology, finance, epidemiology).
* Case studies and practical examples using Julia.

**Software:**

* Julia (version 1.x or later)
* Required Julia packages: `GLM.jl`, `StatsModels.jl`, `DataFrames.jl`, `Plots.jl` (and potentially others depending on specific applications).

**Assessment:**

* Homework assignments (40%) - focusing on applying GLMs to various datasets and interpreting results.
* Midterm exam (30%) - covering the theoretical foundations and practical aspects of GLMs.
* Final project (30%) - involving a real-world data analysis using GLMs in Julia.

**Grading Policy:** Standard grading scale will be used.

**Note:** This syllabus is subject to change at the instructor's discretion.  The specific topics covered and the time allocated to each module may be adjusted based on the students' background and progress.  The Julia-specific aspects will be integrated throughout the course, with hands-on coding exercises and examples in each module.

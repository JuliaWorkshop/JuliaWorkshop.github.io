## Syntax Elements

- **Comments:** Single-line comments start with `#`, and multi-line comments can be placed between `#=` and `=#` (they can be nested).
- **Suppressing Output:** In console mode, a `;` after a command suppresses the output (automatic in scripting mode) and switches to a one-time command shell prompt when typed alone.
- **Indentation:** Indentation doesn't matter, but spaces sometimes do (e.g., functions must have parentheses with inputs attached: `println(x)` OK, `println (x)` ERROR).
- **Indexing:** Julia uses one-based indexing (arrays start from 1, not 0).

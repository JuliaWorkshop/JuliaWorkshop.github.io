### Sampling Functions
<h3>Sampling Functions</h3>
Julia provides several functions for creating samples, depending on the type of sampling you need to perform. Here's a breakdown of common functions and their uses:

**1. `rand()`:**

* **Purpose:** Generates random numbers.  Can be used for simple random sampling with replacement.
* **Usage:**
    * `rand()`: Generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1.
    * `rand(n)`: Generates an array of `n` random floating-point numbers between 0 and 1.
    * `rand(dims...)`: Generates an array with the specified dimensions filled with random floating-point numbers between 0 and 1.
    * `rand(rng, n)`: Generates `n` random numbers using the random number generator `rng`.
    * `rand(1:10, n)`: Generates `n` random integers between 1 and 10 (inclusive). This is useful for simulating dice rolls or drawing numbers from a hat *with replacement*.

**2. `sample()`:**

* **Purpose:**  Provides more general sampling functionality, including with and without replacement, and weighted sampling.
* **Usage:**
    * `sample(population, n)`: Samples `n` elements from `population` *without* replacement.
    * `sample(population, n, replace=true)`: Samples `n` elements from `population` *with* replacement.
    * `sample(population, Weights(weights), n)`: Samples `n` elements from `population` with probabilities proportional to the given `weights`.  `weights` should be a vector of the same length as `population`.
    * `sample(rng, population, n)`:  Samples using the random number generator `rng`.

**3. `shuffle()`:**

* **Purpose:** Randomly shuffles the elements of an array. This can be useful for creating a random permutation of your data, which can then be used for sampling or splitting into training/testing sets.
* **Usage:**
    * `shuffle(arr)`: Returns a new array with the elements of `arr` randomly shuffled.
    * `shuffle!(arr)`: Shuffles the elements of `arr` *in place*.

**4. `randperm()`:**

* **Purpose:** Generates a random permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.  Useful for creating random indices for sampling.
* **Usage:**
    * `randperm(n)`: Returns a random permutation of the integers 1 to `n`.

**5. `StatsBase` functions:**

The `StatsBase` package provides more advanced sampling methods, including:

* `bootstrap`: For bootstrap resampling.
* `stratifiedsample`: For stratified sampling.

You'll need to install the package using `] add StatsBase` in the Julia REPL.

**Choosing the right function:**

* **Simple random sampling with replacement:** Use `rand()` with a range for integers (e.g., `rand(1:10, n)`) or `sample(population, n, replace=true)`.
* **Simple random sampling without replacement:** Use `sample(population, n)`.
* **Weighted sampling:** Use `sample(population, Weights(weights), n)`.
* **Creating random permutations:** Use `randperm()` or `shuffle()`.
* **Advanced sampling techniques (bootstrap, stratified, etc.):** Use functions from the `StatsBase` package.

**Example: Sampling with replacement**

```julia
population = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
n_samples = 10

samples_with_replacement = sample(population, n_samples, replace=true)
println(samples_with_replacement)
```

**Example: Sampling without replacement**

```julia
population = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
n_samples = 3

samples_without_replacement = sample(population, n_samples)
println(samples_without_replacement)
```

**Example: Weighted sampling**

```julia
population = ['A', 'B', 'C']
weights = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]  # Probabilities for each element
n_samples = 10

weighted_samples = sample(population, Weights(weights), n_samples)
println(weighted_samples)
```

Remember to install `StatsBase` if you need its functions:  `] add StatsBase` in the Julia REPL.  Then, `using StatsBase` in your code.

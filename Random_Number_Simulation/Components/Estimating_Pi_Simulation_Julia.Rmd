The Monte Carlo method uses random sampling to estimate numerical results. Here's how it can be used to estimate π:

**The Idea:**

1. **The Circle and the Square:** Imagine a square with sides of length 2 centered at the origin (0,0) of a Cartesian plane. Inside this square, there's a circle with a radius of 1, also centered at the origin.  The circle fits perfectly inside the square.

2. **Area Ratio:** The area of the square is (2 * 2) = 4. The area of the circle is π * (1 * 1) = π.  The ratio of the circle's area to the square's area is π/4.

3. **Random Points:**  If we randomly generate a large number of points within the square, some will fall inside the circle, and some will fall outside.  The *proportion* of points that fall inside the circle should be approximately equal to the ratio of the areas (π/4).

4. **Estimating Pi:** By counting the number of points inside the circle and dividing by the total number of points, we get an approximation of π/4. Multiplying this by 4 gives us an estimate of π.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Generate Random Points:** Generate a large number of random (x, y) coordinates within the square. Since the square has sides of length 2 and is centered at the origin, the x and y coordinates will be between -1 and 1.

2. **Check if Inside Circle:** For each point (x, y), check if it falls inside the circle. A point is inside the circle if its distance from the origin is less than or equal to the radius (1).  We can check this using the distance formula:  x² + y² ≤ 1

3. **Count Points Inside:** Count the number of points that fall inside the circle.

4. **Calculate the Ratio:** Divide the number of points inside the circle by the total number of points generated. This gives an approximation of π/4.

5. **Estimate Pi:** Multiply the ratio by 4 to get an estimate of π.

**Code Example (Python):**

```python
import random

def estimate_pi(num_points):
    """Estimates pi using the Monte Carlo method."""
    points_inside_circle = 0
    for _ in range(num_points):
        x = random.uniform(-1, 1)  # Generate random x between -1 and 1
        y = random.uniform(-1, 1)  # Generate random y between -1 and 1
        if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:      # Check if point is inside the circle
            points_inside_circle += 1
    return 4 * points_inside_circle / num_points

# Example usage:
num_points = 1000000  # Use a large number of points for better accuracy
estimated_pi = estimate_pi(num_points)
print(f"Estimated value of pi: {estimated_pi}")
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

* `random.uniform(-1, 1)` generates a random floating-point number between -1 and 1.
* The loop runs `num_points` times, generating random points and checking if they are inside the circle.
* The function returns the estimated value of pi.

**Accuracy:**

The accuracy of the estimation improves as you use more points.  With a large number of points (millions or billions), you can get a reasonably accurate approximation of π.  However, the Monte Carlo method is a statistical method, so the result is still an approximation.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Monte Carlo Method:** Using random sampling to obtain numerical results.
* **Random Number Generation:** Generating random coordinates.
* **Geometric Probability:** The probability of a point falling within a region is proportional to the region's area.

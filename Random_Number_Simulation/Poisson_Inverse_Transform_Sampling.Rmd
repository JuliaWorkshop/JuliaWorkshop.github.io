**Key Changes and Explanations for Poisson:**

1. **Discrete Distribution:** The Poisson distribution is *discrete* (takes only integer values). This has important implications for visualization and analysis:
   - The histogram bins should be centered on the integers (0, 1, 2, ...).  The code now uses `bins = 0:maximum(random_variates)+1` to achieve this.
   - We overlay the *Probability Mass Function (PMF)*, not the PDF.  The `Plots.jl` code uses `seriestype = :sticks` to represent the PMF correctly.  We also use `pdf.(poisson_dist, x_vals)` to calculate the PMF values using `Distributions.jl`.

2. **Inverse Transform for Poisson:** The inverse transform for Poisson is a bit more involved because the CDF doesn't have a simple closed-form inverse.  We use an iterative approach:
   - We start with `x = 0` and calculate the probability `p` of *X = 0*.
   - We keep incrementing `x` and updating `p` (and the cumulative probability `F`) until `F` exceeds the uniform random number `u`.  This is how we find the "inverse" of the CDF in this case.  The iterative calculation of `p` is more efficient than recalculating factorials each time.

3. **Vectorization (Important for Poisson):** The vectorized version of the Poisson inverse transform is particularly important because the iterative nature of the algorithm can be slow for generating large numbers of samples.  The provided `poisson_inverse_transform_vectorized` function demonstrates how to vectorize the process.  It generates all the random variates in a single loop, which is significantly faster.

4. **Integer Type for Variates:** The generated Poisson random variates are integers. It is good practice to store them as such. Thus, in the vectorized version, `x` is initialized as an array of integers using `zeros(Int, n)`.

5. **Resetting p and F in Vectorized Version:** In the vectorized version, after generating a Poisson random number for each element of the array, `p` and `F` should be reset to their initial values for the next iteration.

With these changes, the code correctly simulates Poisson random variates, provides appropriate visualization and analysis for a discrete distribution, and includes a highly optimized vectorized version.  The explanation highlights the key differences and considerations when working with discrete distributions like the Poisson.

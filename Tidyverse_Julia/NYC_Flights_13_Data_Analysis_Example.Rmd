**Explanation:**

1. **Load necessary packages:**
   - `DataFrames`: Provides data frame functionality for manipulating and analyzing tabular data.
   - `CSV`: Enables reading and writing CSV files.
   - `HTTP`: Allows fetching data from web resources.

2. **Download the data:**
   - The URL of the NYC Flights 13 data on GitHub is retrieved.
   - `HTTP.get` fetches the data from the URL.
   - The response body is converted to a string.

3. **Read the data into a DataFrame:**
   - `CSV.read` reads the data from the string and creates a DataFrame.

4. **Explore the data:**
   - `first(flights, 5)` displays the first 5 rows of the `flights` DataFrame.

5. **Basic analysis:**
   - `sort(flights, :arr_delay, rev=true)` sorts the flights DataFrame by arrival delay in descending order.
   - `first(delayed_flights, 5)` displays the first 5 rows of the sorted DataFrame, showing the most delayed flights.
   - `groupby(flights, :carrier)` groups the flights DataFrame by carrier.
   - `combine(...)` calculates the mean arrival delay for each group and creates a new DataFrame.

This example demonstrates basic usage of the NYC Flights 13 data in Julia. You can further explore the data using various DataFrames.jl functions, such as filtering, joining, and plotting.

```julia
using DataFrames, CSV, HTTP

# Download the NYC Flights 13 data from GitHub
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/nycflights13/master/data-raw/nycflights13.csv"
response = HTTP.get(url)
data = String(response.body)

# Read the data into a DataFrame
flights = CSV.read(IOBuffer(data), DataFrame)

# Inspect the dimensions of the dataset
num_rows, num_cols = size(flights) 
println("Number of rows:", num_rows)
println("Number of columns:", num_cols)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary packages:**
   - `DataFrames`: For working with tabular data.
   - `CSV`: For reading CSV files.
   - `HTTP`: For downloading data from the web.

2. **Download and load the data:** 
   - The code downloads the NYC Flights 13 data from GitHub and reads it into a DataFrame.

3. **Inspect dimensions:**
   - `size(flights)` returns a tuple containing the number of rows and columns of the DataFrame. 
   - The code extracts the number of rows and columns from the tuple and prints them to the console.

This will output the number of rows and columns in the NYC Flights 13 dataset.

**Exercise 1.1: Basic Data Exploration**

```julia
using DataFrames, CSV, HTTP

# Download and load the data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/nycflights13/master/data-raw/nycflights13.csv"
response = HTTP.get(url)
data = String(response.body)
flights = CSV.read(IOBuffer(data), DataFrame)

# Print the first 10 rows
println("First 10 rows:")
show(first(flights, 10))

# Determine the number of rows and columns
num_rows, num_cols = size(flights)
println("Number of rows:", num_rows)
println("Number of columns:", num_cols)

# Print data types of each column
println("Data types of each column:")
for (col_name, col_type) in pairs(eltype(flights))
    println("$col_name: $col_type")
end
```

**Exercise 1.2: Unique Airlines and Flight Counts**

```julia
# Find unique airlines
unique_carriers = unique(flights.carrier)
println("Unique airlines:")
println(unique_carriers)

# Count flights for each carrier
carrier_counts = countmap(flights.carrier)
println("Flight counts for each carrier:")
println(carrier_counts)
```

**Exercise 2.1: Filtering and Selecting Data**

```julia
# Filter flights departing from JFK
jfk_flights = filter(:origin => ==("JFK"), flights)

# Select specific columns
selected_columns = select(jfk_flights, [:carrier, :flight, :origin, :dest])
println("Flights departing from JFK:")
show(selected_columns)
```

**Exercise 2.2: Filtering and Calculating Average Delay**

```julia
# Filter flights with arrival delay > 30 minutes
delayed_flights = filter(:arr_delay => >=(30), flights)

# Calculate average arrival delay
avg_delay = mean(delayed_flights.arr_delay)
println("Average arrival delay for delayed flights:", avg_delay)
```

**Exercise 3.1: Creating a New Column and Calculating Average Delay**

```julia
# Create a new column 'total_delay'
flights_with_total_delay = transform(flights, :total_delay => (x, y) -> x .+ y, :dep_delay, :arr_delay)

# Calculate average total delay for each carrier
avg_total_delay_by_carrier = combine(groupby(flights_with_total_delay, :carrier), :total_delay => mean => :avg_total_delay)
println("Average total delay for each carrier:")
show(avg_total_delay_by_carrier)
```

**Exercise 3.2: Grouping and Counting Flights by Month**

```julia
# Create a new column 'flight_month'
flights_with_month = transform(flights, :flight_month => x -> month(x), :month)

# Group by 'flight_month' and count flights
monthly_flight_counts = combine(groupby(flights_with_month, :flight_month), nrow => :num_flights)
println("Number of flights per month:")
show(monthly_flight_counts)
```

**Exercise 4.1: Data Visualization (requires Plots.jl)**

```julia
using Plots

# Histogram of arrival delays
histogram(flights.arr_delay, xlabel="Arrival Delay (minutes)", ylabel="Frequency", title="Histogram of Arrival Delays")

# Bar chart of flights per carrier
bar(keys(carrier_counts), values(carrier_counts), xlabel="Carrier", ylabel="Number of Flights", title="Flights per Carrier")

# Scatter plot of departure delay vs. arrival delay
scatter(flights.dep_delay, flights.arr_delay, xlabel="Departure Delay (minutes)", ylabel="Arrival Delay (minutes)", title="Departure Delay vs. Arrival Delay")
```

**Note:** These are basic examples. You can further explore and refine these exercises based on the specific learning objectives and the level of your students.

Remember to install the required packages (`DataFrames`, `CSV`, `HTTP`, `Plots`) before running these scripts. You can install them using the Julia package manager:

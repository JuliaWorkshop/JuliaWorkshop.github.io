### TidierFiles.jl 

The `TidierFiles.jl` package in Julia is a powerful tool for handling different file formats such as CSV and Excel in a tidy and efficient way. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of installing `TidierFiles.jl`, and how to use it for reading from and writing to these file formats.

#### Installation

First, you need to install the package. You can do this by using the Julia package manager (Pkg). Open your Julia REPL and run:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("TidierFiles")
```

##### Reading Files

**Reading CSV Files**

To read a CSV file, you can use the `read_csv` function provided by `TidierFiles.jl`. Here's how you can do it:

```julia
using TidierFiles

# Specify the path to your CSV file
csv_file_path = "path/to/your/file.csv"

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = read_csv(csv_file_path)

# Display the DataFrame
println(df)
```

##### Reading Excel Files

Similarly, you can read an Excel file using the `read_excel` function. Here's an example:

```julia
using TidierFiles

# Specify the path to your Excel file
excel_file_path = "path/to/your/file.xlsx"

# Read the Excel file into a DataFrame
df = read_excel(excel_file_path)

# Display the DataFrame
println(df)
```

#### Writing Files

##### Writing CSV Files

To write a DataFrame to a CSV file, you can use the `write_csv` function. Here's how:

```julia
using TidierFiles, DataFrames

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = DataFrame(Name=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], Age=[25, 30, 35])

# Specify the path to save your CSV file
csv_file_path = "path/to/save/your/file.csv"

# Write the DataFrame to a CSV file
write_csv(df, csv_file_path)
```

##### Writing Excel Files

To write a DataFrame to an Excel file, you can use the `write_excel` function. Here's an example:

```julia
using TidierFiles, DataFrames

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = DataFrame(Name=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], Age=[25, 30, 35])

# Specify the path to save your Excel file
excel_file_path = "path/to/save/your/file.xlsx"

# Write the DataFrame to an Excel file
write_excel(df, excel_file_path)
```

#### Conclusion

The `TidierFiles.jl` package provides a simple and efficient way to handle reading and writing various file formats in Julia. By following this tutorial, you should be able to read from and write to CSV and Excel files with ease. Happy coding!

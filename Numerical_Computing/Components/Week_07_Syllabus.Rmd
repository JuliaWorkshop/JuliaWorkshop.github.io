### Week 7: Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

This is a tutorial on numerical solutions of PDEs using Julia.

#### 1. Classification of PDEs

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) can be classified based on their linearity, order, and the nature of the coefficients. Here are some common classifications:

- **Linearity**: Linear vs. Nonlinear
- **Order**: First-order, Second-order, etc.
- **Nature of Coefficients**: Constant coefficients vs. Variable coefficients

In this tutorial, we'll focus on linear second-order PDEs with constant coefficients.

#### 2. Finite Difference Methods for PDEs

Finite difference methods are numerical techniques for solving PDEs by approximating derivatives with difference equations. Here's a simple example using Julia:

```julia
# Define grid size and time step
nx, nt = 100, 100
dx, dt = 1.0/nx, 0.01

# Initialize solution matrix
u = zeros(nx, nt)

# Initial condition
u[:, 1] = sin.(2 * π * (0:dx:1))

# Finite difference loop
for n in 1:nt-1
    for i in 2:nx-1
        u[i, n+1] = u[i, n] + dt * (u[i+1, n] - 2*u[i, n] + u[i-1, n]) / dx^2
    end
end
```

#### 3. Solving Heat and Wave Equations

Let's tackle the heat equation and the wave equation using finite difference methods.

**Heat Equation**:

The heat equation is a PDE that describes the distribution of heat over time. The equation is:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$

Here's how to solve it using Julia:

```julia
# Parameters
α = 0.01
dx, dt = 0.1, 0.001
nx, nt = 100, 1000

# Initialize solution matrix
u = zeros(nx, nt)

# Initial condition
u[:, 1] = sin.(2 * π * (0:dx:1))

# Finite difference loop
for n in 1:nt-1
    for i in 2:nx-1
        u[i, n+1] = u[i, n] + α * dt * (u[i+1, n] - 2*u[i, n] + u[i-1, n]) / dx^2
    end
end
```

**Wave Equation**:

The wave equation describes the propagation of waves. The equation is:

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$

Here's how to solve it using Julia:

```julia
# Parameters
c = 1.0
dx, dt = 0.1, 0.01
nx, nt = 100, 100

# Initialize solution matrices
u = zeros(nx, nt)
u_new = copy(u)
u_old = copy(u)

# Initial condition
u[:, 1] = sin.(2 * π * (0:dx:1))

# Finite difference loop
for n in 2:nt-1
    for i in 2:nx-1
        u_new[i, n+1] = 2*u[i, n] - u_old[i, n] + (c^2 * dt^2 * (u[i+1, n] - 2*u[i, n] + u[i-1, n]) / dx^2)
    end
    u_old = copy(u)
    u = copy(u_new)
end
```

#### 4. Implementing PDE Solvers in Julia

To make the PDE solvers more reusable and modular, we can wrap them into functions.

```julia
function heat_equation_solver(α, dx, dt, nx, nt, initial_condition)
    u = zeros(nx, nt)
    u[:, 1] = initial_condition

    for n in 1:nt-1
        for i in 2:nx-1
            u[i, n+1] = u[i, n] + α * dt * (u[i+1, n] - 2*u[i, n] + u[i-1, n]) / dx^2
        end
    end
    return u
end

function wave_equation_solver(c, dx, dt, nx, nt, initial_condition)
    u = zeros(nx, nt)
    u_new = copy(u)
    u_old = copy(u)
    u[:, 1] = initial_condition

    for n in 2:nt-1
        for i in 2:nx-1
            u_new[i, n+1] = 2*u[i, n] - u_old[i, n] + (c^2 * dt^2 * (u[i+1, n] - 2*u[i, n] + u[i-1, n]) / dx^2)
        end
        u_old = copy(u)
        u = copy(u_new)
    end
    return u
end

# Example usage:
initial_condition = sin.(2 * π * (0:dx:1))
u_heat = heat_equation_solver(0.01, 0.1, 0.001, 100, 1000, initial_condition)
u_wave = wave_equation_solver(1.0, 0.1, 0.01, 100, 100, initial_condition)
```

That's a brief overview of solving PDEs using finite difference methods in Julia.

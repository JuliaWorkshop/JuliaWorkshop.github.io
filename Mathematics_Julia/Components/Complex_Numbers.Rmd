Absolutely! Complex numbers are fascinating and very useful in many areas of mathematics and engineering. Here are some exercises related to complex number functions using Julia, tailored for students:

### Complex Number Functions in Julia: Exercise List

1. **Basic Complex Number Creation:**
   - Create a complex number \( z = 3 + 4i \).

   ```julia
   z = 3 + 4im
   ```

2. **Real and Imaginary Parts:**
   - Extract and print the real and imaginary parts of the complex number \( z = 5 + 12i \).

   ```julia
   z = 5 + 12im
   real_part = real(z)
   imaginary_part = imag(z)
   ```

3. **Complex Conjugate:**
   - Find the complex conjugate of \( z = -2 + 7i \).

   ```julia
   z = -2 + 7im
   conjugate_z = conj(z)
   ```

4. **Magnitude and Phase:**
   - Calculate the magnitude and phase (argument) of \( z = 1 - 1i \).

   ```julia
   z = 1 - 1im
   magnitude = abs(z)
   phase = angle(z)
   ```

5. **Addition and Subtraction:**
   - Perform addition and subtraction on two complex numbers \( z1 = 2 + 3i \) and \( z2 = 1 - 4i \).

   ```julia
   z1 = 2 + 3im
   z2 = 1 - 4im
   sum = z1 + z2
   difference = z1 - z2
   ```

6. **Multiplication and Division:**
   - Multiply and divide two complex numbers \( z1 = 3 + 5i \) and \( z2 = -2 + 2i \).

   ```julia
   z1 = 3 + 5im
   z2 = -2 + 2im
   product = z1 * z2
   quotient = z1 / z2
   ```

7. **Complex Exponential:**
   - Compute the exponential of a complex number \( z = 1 + 2i \).

   ```julia
   z = 1 + 2im
   exp_z = exp(z)
   ```

8. **Complex Logarithm:**
   - Find the natural logarithm of a complex number \( z = 2 + 3i \).

   ```julia
   z = 2 + 3im
   log_z = log(z)
   ```

9. **Plotting Complex Numbers:**
   - Plot the complex numbers \( z1 = 2 + 3i \) and \( z2 = -1 - 4i \) on the complex plane.

   ```julia
   using Plots
   z1 = 2 + 3im
   z2 = -1 - 4im
   scatter([real(z1), real(z2)], [imag(z1), imag(z2)], label="Complex Numbers", legend=false)
   ```

10. **Solving Complex Equations:**
    - Solve the complex equation \( z^2 + 1 = 0 \).

    ```julia
    using Roots
    f(z) = z^2 + 1
    roots(f, -2 + 2im)
    ```

These exercises should help students understand and work with complex numbers using Julia.

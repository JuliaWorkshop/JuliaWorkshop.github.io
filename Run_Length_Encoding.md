Sure! Run Length Encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression where runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive elements) are stored as a single data value and count. Here's how you can implement RLE in Julia:

### Run Length Encoding in Julia

1. **Define the Function**:
   We'll create a function that takes an array as input and returns the run length encoded version of the array.

```julia
function run_length_encoding(arr)
    n = length(arr)
    encoded = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n
        count = 1
        while i + count <= n && arr[i] == arr[i + count]
            count += 1
        end
        push!(encoded, (arr[i], count))
        i += count
    end
    return encoded
end
```

2. **Test the Function**:
   Let's test the function with an example array.

```julia
# Example array
data = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]

# Run Length Encoding
encoded_data = run_length_encoding(data)
println(encoded_data)
```

### Explanation:
- The `run_length_encoding` function iterates through the input array `arr`.
- It counts the number of consecutive elements that are the same (a run) and stores the value and the count as a tuple in the `encoded` array.
- The `while` loop ensures that the function processes the entire array.
- The `push!` function is used to append the tuple (value, count) to the `encoded` array.

### Output:
Running the above code will give you the run length encoded version of the input array.

```julia
[(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
```

This output represents the compressed form of the input array where:
- The number `1` appears `3` times.
- The number `2` appears `2` times.
- The number `3` appears `4` times.
- The number `4` appears `2` times.
- The number `5` appears `1` time.

Feel free to modify the function or the input array to suit your needs! If you have any questions or need further assistance, just let me know!

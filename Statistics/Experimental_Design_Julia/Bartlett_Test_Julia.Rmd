# 1. Create Sample Data (Example - you'll use your own data)
# It's important that each group is in its own column
# You can also have a DataFrame with groups in one column and values in another; see alternative below

# Method 1: Data in separate vectors
group1 = rand(Normal(10, 2), 20)
group2 = rand(Normal(12, 2.5), 25)
group3 = rand(Normal(11, 1.5), 15)

# Method 2: Data in a DataFrame (more common)
df = DataFrame(
    value = vcat(group1, group2, group3),
    group = repeat(["A", "B", "C"], inner = [length(group1), length(group2), length(group3)])
)

# 2. Perform Bartlett's Test (Method 1: Separate vectors)
bartlett_result_vectors = BartlettTest(group1, group2, group3)
println(bartlett_result_vectors)

# 3. Perform Bartlett's Test (Method 2: DataFrame)
bartlett_result_df = BartlettTest(df.value, df.group)
println(bartlett_result_df)


# 4. Interpret the Results
p_value_vectors = pvalue(bartlett_result_vectors)
p_value_df = pvalue(bartlett_result_df)

alpha = 0.05

println("\nResults using separate vectors:")
if p_value_vectors < alpha
    println("Reject null hypothesis: Variances are NOT equal.")
else
    println("Fail to reject null hypothesis: Variances are likely equal.")
end

println("\nResults using DataFrame:")
if p_value_df < alpha
    println("Reject null hypothesis: Variances are NOT equal.")
else
    println("Fail to reject null hypothesis: Variances are likely equal.")
end


# 5. (Optional) Print other statistics
statistic_vectors = statistic(bartlett_result_vectors)
statistic_df = statistic(bartlett_result_df)
println("Bartlett's statistic (vectors): ", statistic_vectors)
println("Bartlett's statistic (DataFrame): ", statistic_df)

# 6. (Optional) Visualizing the data (Boxplots are useful)
using Plots
boxplot([group1, group2, group3], labels = ["Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3"], title = "Boxplots of Groups")
# Or for the DataFrame:
# boxplot(df.value, by = df.group, labels = unique(df.group), title = "Boxplots of Groups")
```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`HypothesisTests` Package:** The `BartlettTest` function is part of the `HypothesisTests` package. Make sure you have it installed: `] add HypothesisTests` and `using HypothesisTests`.

2. **Data Input:** The example demonstrates two ways to provide data to `BartlettTest`:
   - **Separate Vectors:**  If your data is already in separate vectors (one for each group), you can pass them directly to `BartlettTest`.
   - **DataFrame:**  A more common scenario is having your data in a DataFrame.  The code shows how to use `BartlettTest` with a DataFrame, where one column contains the values and another column contains the group labels.  This is generally the preferred method.

3. **Clearer Results:** The code prints the p-value and provides a clear interpretation of the test result (reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis).

4. **Bartlett's Statistic:** The code shows how to access and print the Bartlett's test statistic.

5. **Visualization (Boxplots):**  Boxplots are very helpful for visualizing the data and getting a sense of the variance within each group. The example shows how to create boxplots using `Plots.jl`.  Install it if you don't have it: `] add Plots` and `using Plots`.

6. **Example Data:** The code now generates example data using `rand(Normal(...))`, which creates normally distributed random numbers.  **Replace this with your actual data.**

**How to Use with Your Data:**

1. **Load your data:** Use `CSV.jl`, `DataFrames.jl`, or another appropriate method to load your data into Julia.  If your data is already in separate vectors, you can skip this step.
2. **Create a DataFrame (if needed):** If your data is not already in a DataFrame, create one.  Make sure one column contains the values and another column contains the group labels.
3. **Run the test:** Use `BartlettTest(values_column, group_column)` where `values_column` and `group_column` are the names of the columns in your DataFrame.  Or, if your data is in separate vectors, use `BartlettTest(group1, group2, ...)`.
4. **Interpret the results:** Look at the p-value.  If it's less than your chosen significance level (alpha, usually 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis, meaning there's evidence that the variances are not equal.
5. **Visualize:** Use boxplots to examine the variances visually.

**Important Note:** Bartlett's test is sensitive to deviations from normality. If your data is not normally distributed, Levene's test is a more robust alternative.  `LeveneTest` is also available in `HypothesisTests.jl`.  Use `?LeveneTest` in the Julia REPL for more information.

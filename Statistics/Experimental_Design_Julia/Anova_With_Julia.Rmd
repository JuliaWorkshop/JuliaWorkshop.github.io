### Tutorial: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) in Julia

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) in Julia using the `StatsModels.jl` and `GLM.jl` packages. ANOVA is a statistical test used to compare the means of two or more groups.

**1. Setting Up:**

Install the necessary packages:

```julia
] add StatsModels GLM DataFrames
```

Load the packages:

```julia
using StatsModels
using GLM
using DataFrames
using Distributions # For generating sample data
using Plots # For visualization
```

**2. Generating Sample Data:**

Let's create some sample data for a one-way ANOVA. We'll simulate three groups with different means but similar variances.

```julia
n = 50  # Number of observations per group
mu1 = 10; mu2 = 12; mu3 = 15 # Group means
sigma = 2 # Common standard deviation

group1 = rand(Normal(mu1, sigma), n)
group2 = rand(Normal(mu2, sigma), n)
group3 = rand(Normal(mu3, sigma), n)

# Create a DataFrame
df = DataFrame(
    value = vcat(group1, group2, group3),
    group = repeat(["A", "B", "C"], inner = n)
)
```

**3. Performing One-Way ANOVA:**

```julia
# Define the model formula
formula = @formula(value ~ group)

# Fit the linear model
model = lm(formula, df)

# Perform ANOVA
anova_table = anova(model)

# Print the ANOVA table
println(anova_table)

# Extract the p-value
p_value = anova_table[1, 5] # Assuming the 'Pr(>F)' column is the 5th
println("P-value: ", p_value)

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha
    println("Reject null hypothesis: At least one group mean is different.")
else
    println("Fail to reject null hypothesis: No significant difference between group means.")
end

```

**4. Performing Two-Way ANOVA:**

Let's create data for a two-way ANOVA with two factors (e.g., treatment and time).

```julia
n = 30 # Observations per cell
treatments = ["Control", "Treatment A", "Treatment B"]
times = ["Pre", "Post"]

data = DataFrame(
    value = Float64[],
    treatment = String[],
    time = String[]
)

for t in treatments, tm in times
    mu = (t == "Control" ? 10 : (t == "Treatment A" ? 12 : 15)) + (tm == "Post" ? 3 : 0) # Example means
    push!(data, DataFrame(value = rand(Normal(mu, 2), n), treatment = repeat([t], n), time = repeat([tm], n)))
end

# Define and fit the model (with interaction)
formula_2way = @formula(value ~ treatment * time)
model_2way = lm(formula_2way, data)

# Perform ANOVA
anova_table_2way = anova(model_2way)
println(anova_table_2way)

# Extract p-values (example)
p_treatment = anova_table_2way[1, 5]
p_time = anova_table_2way[2, 5]
p_interaction = anova_table_2way[3, 5]

println("P-value for treatment: ", p_treatment)
println("P-value for time: ", p_time)
println("P-value for interaction: ", p_interaction)

```

**5. Post-Hoc Tests (if ANOVA is significant):**

If the ANOVA is significant (p-value < alpha), you'll want to perform post-hoc tests to determine *which* groups are different.  The `MultivariateStats.jl` package can be useful for this.  A common post-hoc test is Tukey's HSD.

```julia
using MultivariateStats

if p_value < alpha # Only if ANOVA is significant
    tukey_result = tukeycompare(model, :group) # Compare all pairs of groups
    println(tukey_result)
end

if p_interaction < alpha # For two-way ANOVA
    tukey_result_treatment = tukeycompare(model_2way, :treatment)
    println(tukey_result_treatment)
    tukey_result_time = tukeycompare(model_2way, :time)
    println(tukey_result_time)
end

```

**6. Visualizing the Results:**

Boxplots are excellent for visualizing ANOVA results:

```julia
# One-way ANOVA
boxplot(df.value, by = df.group, labels = ["A", "B", "C"], title = "One-Way ANOVA Results")

# Two-way ANOVA (example)
using Plots
boxplot(data.value, by = [data.treatment, data.time], 
        labels = reshape([t * " - " * tm for t in treatments, tm in times], (length(treatments), length(times))),
        title = "Two-Way ANOVA Results")

```

**7. Assumptions of ANOVA:**

* **Normality:** The residuals (errors) of the model should be approximately normally distributed.  Check this with a Q-Q plot or Shapiro-Wilk test.
* **Homogeneity of Variance (Homoscedasticity):** The variances of the groups should be approximately equal.  Levene's test can be used to check this.
* **Independence:** The observations should be independent of each other.

**Example of checking normality of residuals:**

```julia
using Plots
residuals = model.residuals
qqplot(residuals) # Q-Q plot
#shapiro_wilk(residuals)  # Shapiro-Wilk test (from HypothesisTests.jl)
```

**Example of Levene's Test (for homogeneity of variance):**

```julia
using HypothesisTests
levene_result = LeveneTest(df.value, df.group)
println(levene_result)
```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Clearer Data Generation:** The sample data generation is more organized and allows for easy adjustment of means and standard deviations.
* **DataFrame Use:** Using DataFrames makes the data handling and model specification much cleaner.
* **Formula Macro:** The `@formula` macro simplifies model definition.
* **ANOVA Table:** The `anova()` function provides a nicely formatted ANOVA table.
* **P-value Extraction:** The code shows how to extract the p-value from the ANOVA table.
* **Two-Way ANOVA:** Added a clear example of how to perform a two-way ANOVA, including interaction effects.
* **Post-Hoc Tests:** Included a section on how to perform Tukey's HSD post-hoc test using `tukeycompare` from `MultivariateStats.jl`. This is essential after a significant ANOVA to know *which* groups differ.
* **Visualization:** Added boxplot examples for both one-way and two-way ANOVA results.  Boxplots are very effective for visualizing group differences.
* **Assumption Checking:** Added examples of how to check the assumptions of normality (Q-Q plot, Shapiro-Wilk) and homogeneity of variance (Levene's test). This is *crucial* for the validity of the ANOVA results.

This tutorial provides a solid foundation for ANOVA in Julia. Remember to always check the assumptions of ANOVA and perform post-hoc tests when necessary.  For more complex designs or specific post-hoc tests, refer to the documentation of the relevant packages.

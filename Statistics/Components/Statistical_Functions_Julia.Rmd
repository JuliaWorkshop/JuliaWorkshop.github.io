### Tutorial: Basic Statistical Functions in Julia

Julia provides a rich set of functions for performing statistical calculations.  This tutorial will cover some of the most common ones, demonstrating their usage with examples.

---

**1. Mean:**

The `mean()` function calculates the arithmetic mean of a collection of numbers.

```julia
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = mean(data)
println("Mean: ", average) # Output: Mean: 3.0

data_float = [1.0, 2.5, 3.7, 4.2, 5.1]
avg_float = mean(data_float)
println("Mean (Float): ", avg_float) # Output: Mean (Float): 3.3

#For other collection types
data_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
avg_tuple = mean(data_tuple)
println("Mean (Tuple): ", avg_tuple) # Output: Mean (Tuple): 3.0

data_set = Set([1,2,3,4,5])
avg_set = mean(data_set)
println("Mean (Set): ", avg_set) # Output: Mean (Set): 3.0
```

---

**2. Median:**

The `median()` function returns the middle value of a sorted collection.

```julia
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
med = median(data)
println("Median: ", med) # Output: Median: 3.0

data_even = [1, 2, 3, 4]
med_even = median(data_even)
println("Median (Even): ", med_even) # Output: Median (Even): 2.5
```

---

**3. Standard Deviation:**

The `std()` function calculates the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of data around the mean.

```julia
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
stdev = std(data)
println("Standard Deviation: ", stdev) # Output: Standard Deviation: 1.5811388300841898

#To calculate standard deviation of a population instead of a sample, use the stdevp() function.
stdev_pop = stdp(data)
println("Population Standard Deviation: ", stdev_pop) # Output: Population Standard Deviation: 1.4142135623730951
```

**4. Variance:**

The `var()` function calculates the variance, the square of the standard deviation.

```julia
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
variance = var(data)
println("Variance: ", variance) # Output: Variance: 2.5

#To calculate variance of a population instead of a sample, use the varp() function.
variance_pop = varp(data)
println("Population Variance: ", variance_pop) # Output: Population Variance: 2.0
```

---

**5. Minimum and Maximum:**

The `minimum()` and `maximum()` functions find the smallest and largest values in a collection.  `extrema()` returns both.

```julia
data = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
min_val = minimum(data)
max_val = maximum(data)
extrema_val = extrema(data)

println("Minimum: ", min_val) # Output: Minimum: 1
println("Maximum: ", max_val) # Output: Maximum: 9
println("Extrema: ", extrema_val) # Output: Extrema: (1, 9)
```

**6. Quantiles:**

The `quantile()` function calculates quantiles, which divide the data into equal parts.

```julia
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
q25 = quantile(data, 0.25) # 25th percentile
q50 = quantile(data, 0.5)  # 50th percentile (median)
q75 = quantile(data, 0.75) # 75th percentile

println("25th Quantile: ", q25) # Output: 25th Quantile: 3.25
println("50th Quantile: ", q50) # Output: 50th Quantile: 5.5
println("75th Quantile: ", q75) # Output: 75th Quantile: 7.75
```

**7.  `describe()` (from `DataFrames.jl`):**

For a more comprehensive summary of descriptive statistics, the `describe()` function from the `DataFrames.jl` package is very helpful, especially when working with tabular data.

```julia
using DataFrames

df = DataFrame(A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [2.1, 3.2, 4.3, 5.4, 6.5])
summary_stats = describe(df)
println(summary_stats)
```

This will output a table containing count, mean, std, min, median, max, and other statistics for each column in the DataFrame.  Remember to install `DataFrames.jl` first using `] add DataFrames` in the Julia REPL.

---

**Example: Combining functions:**

```julia
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
avg = mean(data)
stdev = std(data)
println("Mean: ", avg, ", Standard Deviation: ", stdev)

zscores = (data .- avg) ./ stdev  # Calculate z-scores
println("Z-scores: ", zscores)
```

This tutorial covers the basics. Julia's statistical capabilities extend far beyond these functions. The `StatsBase.jl` package provides a wide array of more advanced statistical tools.  Remember to consult the Julia documentation for more in-depth information and further functions.

Let's explore more statistical functions available in base Julia and the `StatsBase.jl` package.

**Base Julia (Built-in Functions):**

Beyond the basic functions (mean, median, std, var, min, max, quantile) we discussed before, base Julia offers several other useful statistical functions:

* **`sum(x)`:** Calculates the sum of all elements in `x`.
* **`prod(x)`:** Calculates the product of all elements in `x`.
* **`cumsum(x)`:** Calculates the cumulative sum of `x`.  Returns a vector of the same length as `x`.
* **`cumprod(x)`:** Calculates the cumulative product of `x`.
* **`diff(x)`:** Calculates the differences between consecutive elements of `x`.
* **`cor(x, y)`:** Computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between vectors `x` and `y`.
* **`cov(x, y)`:** Computes the covariance between vectors `x` and `y`.
* **`hist(x)`:**  Creates a histogram (returns a tuple containing edges and counts).  `Plots.jl` is often used to visualize the histogram.
* **`range(start, stop, length)`:** Generates an evenly spaced range of numbers. Useful for creating data for statistical analysis or plotting.
* **`rand(n)`:** Generates `n` random numbers between 0 and 1.
* **`randn(n)`:** Generates `n` standard normal (mean 0, standard deviation 1) random numbers.
* **`mean(f, x)`:**  Calculates the mean of `f(x)` where `f` is a function.  Useful for weighted averages or transformations.
* **`map(f, x)`:** Applies the function `f` to each element of `x` and returns a new collection.  Helpful for data preprocessing before statistical analysis.
* **`filter(f, x)`:** Returns a new collection containing only the elements of `x` for which the function `f` returns `true`. Useful for subsetting your data.

**`StatsBase.jl` Package:**

`StatsBase.jl` significantly expands Julia's statistical capabilities. Here are some key functions and concepts it provides:



* **Descriptive Statistics:**
    * `modes(x)`: Returns the mode(s) of a dataset.
    * `skewness(x)`: Measures the asymmetry of the data distribution.
    * `kurtosis(x)`: Measures the "tailedness" of the data distribution.
    * `describe(x)`: Provides a summary of descriptive statistics.
    * `percentile(x, p)`: Calculates the p-th percentile.
    * `iqr(x)`: Calculates the interquartile range.
* **Distributions:** `StatsBase.jl` integrates well with the `Distributions.jl` package, which provides a wide variety of probability distributions.  You can work with these distributions to perform calculations related to probabilities, quantiles, fitting data to distributions, etc.
* **Hypothesis Testing:**  `StatsBase.jl`, in conjunction with other packages, supports hypothesis testing.
* **Regression:** While basic linear regression can be done with matrix operations, more advanced regression models are typically handled by packages like `GLM.jl` (Generalized Linear Models).
* **Resampling:** `StatsBase.jl` provides tools for bootstrapping and other resampling techniques.
* **Ranking and Ordering:** Functions for ranking data and handling ties.
* **Weights:** Many functions in `StatsBase.jl` accept weights, allowing you to perform weighted statistical calculations.
* **Sampling:** Functions for different sampling methods.

**Example using `StatsBase.jl`:**

```julia
using StatsBase

data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]

println("Mode: ", modes(data))        # Output: Mode: [4]
println("Skewness: ", skewness(data))    # Output: Skewness: 0.475206912734336
println("Kurtosis: ", kurtosis(data))    # Output: Kurtosis: -0.5265625
println("Percentile (75th): ", percentile(data, 75)) # Output: Percentile (75th): 4.0
println("Interquartile Range: ", iqr(data)) # Output: Interquartile Range: 2.5
println("Describe: \n", describe(data)) # Output: Describe: (summary statistics)

# Using weights
weights = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1] # Example weights
println("Weighted Mean: ", mean(data, weights)) # Output: Weighted Mean: 3.5294117647058822
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Installation:** You'll need to install `StatsBase.jl` before using it.  In the Julia REPL, type `] add StatsBase`.
* **Documentation:** The `StatsBase.jl` documentation is your best resource for a complete list of functions and their usage.  You can access it online or within the Julia REPL using `?StatsBase`.
* **Other Packages:** For more specialized statistical tasks (like time series analysis, survival analysis, or advanced modeling), you might need to explore other packages in the Julia ecosystem.

This expanded list and example should give you a better overview of the statistical functions available in Julia. Remember to consult the documentation for the most up-to-date information and details on function usage.

```julia
using HypothesisTests

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
before = [10, 12, 15, 18, 20]
after = [12, 14, 17, 20, 22]

# Perform the paired t-test
t_test = ttest(before, after, paired=true)

# Extract the p-value
p_value = pvalue(t_test)

# Print the results
println("Paired t-test Results:")
println("Test Statistic:", statistic(t_test))
println("p-value:", p_value)

# Interpretation
if p_value < 0.05
    println("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a statistically significant difference between the paired samples.")
else
    println("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically significant difference between the paired samples.")
end
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import the `HypothesisTests` package:** This line imports the necessary package for performing statistical tests in Julia.
2. **Define sample data:** Replace the example data with your actual data.
3. **Perform the paired t-test:**
   - `ttest(before, after, paired=true)` performs the paired t-test. The `paired=true` argument specifies that the data is paired.
4. **Extract the p-value:** `pvalue(t_test)` extracts the p-value from the test result.
5. **Print the results:** This section prints the test statistic and p-value.
6. **Interpretation:**
   - If the p-value is less than 0.05 (or your chosen significance level), you reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the paired samples.
   - If the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, you fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no statistically significant difference between the paired samples.

This code demonstrates how to perform a paired t-test in Julia using the `HypothesisTests` package. Remember to adjust the significance level and interpret the results based on your specific research question and data.

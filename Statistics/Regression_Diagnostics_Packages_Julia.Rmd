### Regression Diagnostics with Julia 
<h3>Regression Diagnostics with Julia</h3>
There are several Julia packages that can assist you with regression diagnostics. Here are a few of them:

1. **GLM.jl:** The Generalized Linear Models package is the go-to for fitting linear and generalized linear models.
   ```julia
   using GLM
   ```

2. **Plots.jl and StatsPlots.jl:** These packages are excellent for creating diagnostic plots.
   ```julia
   using Plots
   using StatsPlots
   ```

3. **HypothesisTests.jl:** This package contains various statistical tests, including those for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.
   ```julia
   using HypothesisTests
   ```

4. **RegressionDiagnostics.jl:** This package provides tools for checking multicollinearity, among other diagnostic tests.
   ```julia
   using RegressionDiagnostics
   ```

5. **DataFrames.jl:** While not strictly for diagnostics, this package is incredibly useful for data manipulation and preparation.
   ```julia
   using DataFrames
   ```

6. **StatsBase.jl:** Provides basic statistical functions that can be helpful in diagnostics.
   ```julia
   using StatsBase
   ```

By combining these packages, you can perform a thorough analysis and diagnostics of your regression models. Each package has its own set of functionalities that complement the others, making the entire diagnostic process smoother and more comprehensive.

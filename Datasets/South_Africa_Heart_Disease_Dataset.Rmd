### South Africa Heart Disease dataset

The South Africa Heart Disease dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) in a high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa. This dataset consists of a retrospective sample of males, with roughly two controls for each case of CHD. Many CHD-positive men in the dataset have undergone treatments like blood pressure reduction and other programs aimed at reducing their risk factors after their CHD event. Some measurements in the dataset may reflect values taken after these treatments.

#### Features of the Dataset:
1. **sbp**: Systolic blood pressure.
2. **tobacco**: Cumulative tobacco (kg).
3. **ldl**: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
4. **adiposity**: A measure of body fat.
5. **famhist**: Family history of heart disease, a categorical variable ("Present" or "Absent").
6. **typea**: Type-A behavior scale (a measure of stress or aggression).
7. **obesity**: Obesity index.
8. **alcohol**: Current alcohol consumption.
9. **age**: Age of the subject.
10. **chd**: Coronary heart disease status (1 = presence, 0 = absence).

#### Summary:
- **Observations**: 462 individuals.
- **Variables**: 10 features related to health and lifestyle, and one target variable indicating CHD status.

#### Data Context:
- **Region**: Western Cape, South Africa.
- **Population**: Males in a heart-disease high-risk region.
- **Data Type**: Retrospective sample with mixed numerical and categorical features.

#### Usage:
The dataset is often used for:
- Understanding risk factors associated with heart disease.
- Teaching statistical and machine learning methods.
- Performing exploratory data analysis.
- Developing predictive models for heart disease.

#### Example Data:
Here is a brief look at some sample data points from the dataset:

| sbp | tobacco | ldl | adiposity | famhist | typea | obesity | alcohol | age | chd |
|-----|---------|-----|-----------|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----|-----|
| 160 | 12.0    | 5.73| 23.11     | Present | 49    | 25.30   | 97.20   | 52  | 1   |
| 144 | 0.01    | 4.41| 28.61     | Absent  | 55    | 28.87   | 2.06    | 63  | 1   |
| 118 | 0.08    | 3.48| 32.28     | Present | 52    | 29.14   | 3.81    | 46  | 0   |

This dataset provides a rich source of data for practicing and applying various data analysis and machine learning techniques.
